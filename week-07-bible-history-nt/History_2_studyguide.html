    <h1>‚ú® Session 2: Promise Land to Promised King</h1>
    <p class="center italic">How God Kept Every Promise He Ever Made</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h2>üéâ Welcome Back, Friends!</h2>
    
    <p>If you were here for Session 1, you know we ended with the ultimate cliffhanger: Moses died on Mount Nebo, looking at the Promised Land he couldn't enter. An entire generation perished in the wilderness because of unbelief. Only Joshua and Caleb from the original generation would cross the Jordan.</p>
    
    <p>Today, we're going to complete this incredible journey - from Joshua through the rest of the Old Testament, and then discover how Jesus beautifully fulfills every broken covenant and every unfulfilled promise. We'll spend lots of time with Jesus - the One who is the solution to every problem, the fulfillment of every promise, and the answer to every broken covenant.</p>
    
    <p>Here's what God did: He didn't lower His standards. He didn't pretend sin didn't matter. Instead, He did something so unexpected, so costly, so beautiful that it takes your breath away - <span class="highlight">He kept all His promises Himself.</span></p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "The most important thing that happens in the life of the universe is that Jesus Christ dies and rises again" - John Piper
    </div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üôè Opening Prayer (3 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üìã Where We Left Off</h2>
    
    <p><span class="bold">The Covenant Scorecard from Session 1:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Creation Covenant:</span> Broken by disobedience</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Abrahamic Covenant:</span> God made with Himself (unconditional)</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Mosaic Covenant:</span> Broken repeatedly in the wilderness</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <span class="bold">The Pattern:</span> When covenants depend on human faithfulness ‚Üí BROKEN. When they depend on God's faithfulness ‚Üí ENDURE FOREVER.
    </div>
    
    <p>Now let's see if this new generation can succeed where their parents failed...</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">‚öîÔ∏è Conquest of the Promised Land (3 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üèûÔ∏è Joshua: Finally Entering!</h2>
    
    <p>After Moses dies, God speaks to Joshua: "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."</p>
    
    <p>After 40 years of wandering, the new generation is ready. God parts the Jordan River (just like the Red Sea!), and they finally enter the land God promised Abraham 500 years earlier!</p>
    
    <h3>The Walls of Jericho üé∫</h3>
    
    <p>The first city they face is Jericho, with massive walls. God's battle plan? March around the city once a day for six days. On the seventh day, march seven times, blow trumpets, and shout! When they obey, the walls collapse!</p>
    
    <p>This shows that victory comes not through human strength but through trusting and obeying God. But here's the problem: God commanded them to drive out all the Canaanites, but they get comfortable and leave many in the land. <span class="highlight">This partial obedience will haunt them for centuries.</span></p>
    
    <div class="time-marker">‚öñÔ∏è The Judges: Chaos and Cycles (3 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üîÑ When Everyone Does What's Right in Their Own Eyes</h2>
    
    <p>After Joshua dies, Israel has no central leader. What follows is 300+ years of chaos. The book of Judges records this depressing cycle repeated seven times:</p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Israel does evil and worships idols</li>
        <li>God allows enemies to oppress them</li>
        <li>Israel cries out to God</li>
        <li>God raises up a judge to deliver them</li>
        <li>Peace while the judge lives</li>
        <li>The judge dies, cycle repeats</li>
    </ol>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as they saw fit." - Judges 21:25
    </div>
    
    <p>The book ends with horrific stories. Israel has become as bad as the Canaanites they were supposed to drive out. They desperately need a king.</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üëë The Kings of Israel (7 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>ü§¥ Human Kings Can't Save</h2>
    
    <p>The people come to Samuel the prophet: "Give us a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have." This breaks God's heart - HE is supposed to be their king! But they want to be like everyone else.</p>
    
    <h3>Saul: The King Who Failed</h3>
    
    <p>God gives them Saul - tall, handsome, impressive. He starts well but soon reveals his true heart. He partially obeys God's commands, makes excuses, and cares more about people's opinions than God's. Samuel tells him: "Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you as king."</p>
    
    <h3>David: A Man After God's Heart</h3>
    
    <p>God sends Samuel to anoint the next king from Jesse's sons. Jesse parades seven impressive sons, but God rejects them all. "The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."</p>
    
    <p>Finally, they call in the youngest - David, the shepherd boy. When he later faces Goliath, he declares: "You come against me with sword and spear... but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty!" <span class="highlight">This pictures how Jesus, the son of David, would defeat our greatest enemy with what seemed like weakness.</span></p>
    
    <h3>The Davidic Covenant</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever." - 2 Samuel 7:16
    </div>
    
    <p>How can a human throne last forever? This is another promise pointing to Jesus, the eternal King! But even David falls into terrible sin - adultery and murder. Even the best human king is deeply flawed.</p>
    
    <h3>Solomon's Glory and Failure</h3>
    
    <p>David's son Solomon asks God for wisdom and builds the magnificent temple. When it's dedicated, God's glory fills it so powerfully that priests can't stand to minister! But Solomon marries 700 wives who turn his heart to other gods. The wisest man who ever lived becomes a fool through disobedience.</p>
    
    <p>After Solomon dies, the kingdom splits in two. Most kings are wicked. The northern kingdom doesn't have a single good king!</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üíî Exile: Everything Falls Apart (7 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üò¢ The Consequences of Covenant Breaking</h2>
    
    <p>In 722 BC, the northern kingdom is conquered by Assyria. The ten tribes are scattered and largely lost to history. In 586 BC, Babylon conquers the southern kingdom of Judah.</p>
    
    <p>The unthinkable happens: The temple - God's dwelling place - is destroyed. The ark disappears. The city walls are torn down. The best and brightest are carried off to Babylon.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "By the rivers of Babylon we sat and wept when we remembered Zion... How can we sing the songs of the Lord while in a foreign land?" - Psalm 137:1,4
    </div>
    
    <h3>But God Speaks Through Prophets!</h3>
    
    <p>Even in exile, God sends prophets with messages of hope:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Isaiah:</strong> A virgin will bear a son called Immanuel</li>
        <li><strong>Jeremiah:</strong> God will make a New Covenant written on hearts</li>
        <li><strong>Ezekiel:</strong> God will put His Spirit in His people</li>
        <li><strong>Daniel:</strong> An eternal kingdom is coming</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering... he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed." - Isaiah 53:3,5
    </div>
    
    <p>After 70 years, a remnant returns to rebuild the temple and walls. But they're still under foreign rule with no king on David's throne. Every covenant seems unfulfilled:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Abrahamic:</strong> How will all nations be blessed?</li>
        <li><strong>Mosaic:</strong> Who can keep the law perfectly?</li>
        <li><strong>Davidic:</strong> Where is the eternal king?</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>400 Years of Silence</h3>
    
    <p>After Malachi, God goes quiet for 400 years. No prophets, no miracles. The Jews are conquered by Greeks, then Romans. They're waiting for the Messiah, many expecting a political liberator. The stage is set for God's ultimate answer...</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="discussion-box">
        <span class="bold">üí≠ Discussion Moment:</span> We've seen the pattern: God blesses ‚Üí People turn away ‚Üí Judgment ‚Üí People cry out ‚Üí God rescues ‚Üí Repeat. Why do you think external things like laws, leaders, and temples couldn't change human hearts?
    </div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üë∂ The Incredible Incarnation (8 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üåü When Heaven Invaded Earth</h2>
    
    <p>In the backwater town of Nazareth lives a teenage girl named Mary, engaged to Joseph the carpenter. One day, the angel Gabriel appears: "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you."</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob's descendants forever." - Luke 1:31-33
    </div>
    
    <p>Notice: "throne of his father David" - the Davidic covenant will be fulfilled through this child!</p>
    
    <h3>The Virgin Birth</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called the Son of God." - Luke 1:35
    </div>
    
    <p>This is crucial! Jesus had to be fully human to represent us, but conceived by the Holy Spirit to be without sin. He couldn't inherit Adam's sin nature.</p>
    
    <p>When Joseph finds out Mary is pregnant, an angel tells him: "Joseph son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary home as your wife, because what is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit." Joseph is from David's royal line - Jesus will have legal claim to David's throne!</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: 'The virgin will conceive and give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel' (which means 'God with us')." - Matthew 1:22-23
    </div>
    
    <p>Isaiah prophesied this 700 years earlier! Even Jesus' birthplace in Bethlehem was prophesied by Micah 700 years before. Caesar's census forced them to travel there at exactly the right time!</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>Why Become Human?</h3>
    
    <div class="incarnation-box">
        <p><span class="bold">Problem #1 - Justice:</span> Sin must be punished. Someone had to pay.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Solution:</span> God became human so He could die in our place.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="bold">Problem #2 - Representation:</span> Covenants were made with humanity.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Solution:</span> Jesus became the "Second Adam" to represent us perfectly.</p>
        <br>
        <p><span class="bold">Problem #3 - Righteousness:</span> Perfect obedience was required.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Solution:</span> Jesus lived the sinless life we couldn't live.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "The Son of God became a man to enable men to become sons of God." - C.S. Lewis
    </div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üëë Jesus' Ministry (8 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üåÖ The Kingdom Has Come!</h2>
    
    <p>At about 30, Jesus is baptized by John. As He comes up from the water, heaven opens, the Spirit descends like a dove, and the Father speaks: "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."</p>
    
    <p>The Spirit then leads Jesus into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan for 40 days. Where Adam failed in a perfect garden, Jesus succeeds in a barren wilderness. The Second Adam is proving He can't be defeated!</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!" - Mark 1:15
    </div>
    
    <h3>Jesus and the Law</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them." - Matthew 5:17
    </div>
    
    <p>Some think God was harsh in the Old Testament but "laid back" in the New Testament. <span class="bold">This is completely wrong!</span> God's character never changed. What changed was that Jesus perfectly fulfilled every requirement of the Law on our behalf.</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>Teaching Through Parables</h3>
    
    <p>Jesus taught mainly through parables - simple stories revealing deep truths about God's kingdom:</p>
    
    <div class="parable-box">
        <p><span class="bold">The Lost Sheep:</span> God leaves 99 to find 1. You're not just one of billions - you're the one He'd leave everything to find.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="parable-box">
        <p><span class="bold">The Prodigal Son:</span> The father runs to the returning son. God's love isn't based on performance - He's watching for our return.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="parable-box">
        <p><span class="bold">The Good Samaritan:</span> Love is action that crosses boundaries to help those in need.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Miracles Demonstrate the Kingdom</h3>
    
    <p>Jesus didn't just teach - He demonstrated God's kingdom:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Healing:</span> No sickness in God's kingdom</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Feeding multitudes:</span> God provides abundantly</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Calming storms:</span> Authority over chaos</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Raising the dead:</span> Death itself defeated</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Jesus even fulfilled the Jewish feasts - He is the Passover Lamb, the sinless bread, the first fruits of resurrection!</p>

    <h2>üìÖ The Week That Changed History</h2>
    
    <p>As Jesus' ministry neared its end, He set His face toward Jerusalem. He knew what was waiting, but He went anyway. <span class="highlight">This was why He had come.</span></p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">Palm Sunday:</span> Crowds welcomed Him as king, shouting "Hosanna!" They wanted a political savior. Jesus came as a different kind of king.</p>
    
    <h3>The Last Supper: A New Covenant!</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "This is my body given for you... This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which is poured out for you." - Luke 22:19-20
    </div>
    
    <p>Remember Jeremiah's prophecy about a New Covenant written on hearts? It's happening! Jesus is the true Passover Lamb whose blood delivers us from a greater bondage than Egypt!</p>
    
    <h3>The Agony and Arrest</h3>
    
    <p>In Gethsemane, Jesus prays: "Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will." He's in such agony that His sweat is like drops of blood.</p>
    
    <p>What's in this cup? The full wrath of God against all human sin. Jesus, who has never sinned, is about to become sin for us.</p>
    
    <h3>Good Friday: The Solution to Every Problem</h3>
    
    <div class="cross-box">
        <p><span class="bold">9 AM:</span> They nail Jesus to a cross</p>
        <p><span class="bold">His first words:</span> "Father, forgive them"</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Noon to 3 PM:</span> Darkness covers the land</p>
        <p><span class="bold">3 PM:</span> "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Jesus is quoting Psalm 22 - pointing everyone to David's prophecy being fulfilled before their eyes. David described crucifixion 1000 years before it was invented!</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>"It Is Finished!"</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "When he had received the drink, Jesus said, 'It is finished.' With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit." - John 19:30
    </div>
    
    <p>"Tetelestai" - "PAID IN FULL!" Not a cry of defeat but of VICTORY! Every covenant fulfilled, every sin paid for. At that moment, the temple veil tore from top to bottom - the way to God is now open!</p>
    
    <h3>What the Cross Accomplished</h3>
    
    <div class="cross-box">
        <p><span class="bold">Substitution:</span> Jesus died in our place</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Propitiation:</span> God's wrath was satisfied</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Redemption:</span> We were bought back from slavery</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Reconciliation:</span> The relationship was restored</p>

    <h3>The Great Commission</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations..." - Matthew 28:18-19

    <h2>‚ö° The Holy Spirit Comes to Stay</h2>
    
    <p>Fifty days after Jesus' resurrection, 120 believers are praying when suddenly a sound like violent wind fills the house. Tongues of fire rest on each believer. They're filled with the Holy Spirit and begin speaking in languages they've never learned!</p>
    
    <p>Peter, who denied Jesus weeks earlier, boldly preaches to thousands. Three thousand people are baptized that day!</p>
