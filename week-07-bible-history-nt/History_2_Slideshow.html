            <h1>✨ Session 2: The Solution and the Fulfillment</h1>
            <h2>From Joshua to Jesus: How God Kept Every Promise</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px;">The rest of the Old Testament story and the beautiful climax in Christ</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 2: Welcome Back -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">2/87</div>
            <h2>Welcome Back, Guys! 👋</h2>
            <p>Last week, we left off with the ultimate cliffhanger. Moses died on Mount Nebo, looking at the Promised Land he couldn't enter. An entire generation perished in the wilderness because of unbelief. Only Joshua and Caleb from the original generation would cross the Jordan.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Tonight, we'll see if this new generation succeeds where their parents failed. And we'll discover how God solves the ultimate problem - our inability to keep His covenants. The answer is more beautiful than you could imagine!</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: The Pattern So Far -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">3/87</div>
            <h2>The Pattern We've Seen</h2>
            <div class="covenant-box">
                <p>When covenants depend on human faithfulness → ALWAYS BROKEN</p>
                <p>When covenants depend on God's faithfulness → NEVER BROKEN</p>
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Keep watching for this pattern as we continue the story. It becomes crucial for understanding why Jesus had to come!</p>

            <div class="slide-number">5/87</div>
            <h2>Joshua: Finally Entering! 🏞️</h2>
            <p>After Moses dies, God speaks to Joshua: "Be strong and courageous. Do not be afraid; do not be discouraged, for the Lord your God will be with you wherever you go."</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">After 40 years of wandering, the new generation is ready. God parts the Jordan River (just like the Red Sea!), and they finally enter the land God promised Abraham 500 years earlier!</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 6: Jericho Falls -->
        <div class="slide story-slide">

            <div class="story-text">
                <p>The first city they face is Jericho, with massive walls. God's battle plan? March around the city once a day for six days. On the seventh day, march seven times, blow trumpets, and shout!</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">When they obey, the walls collapse! This shows that victory comes not through human strength but through trusting and obeying God. The conquest of Canaan has begun.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 25px;"><span class="highlight">This partial obedience will haunt them for centuries.</span> The remaining Canaanites will lead them into idolatry again and again.</p>

            <h2>The Depressing Cycle 🔄</h2>
            <p>After Joshua dies, Israel has no central leader. What follows is 300+ years of chaos. The book of Judges records this cycle repeated seven times:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Israel does evil and worships idols</li>
                <li>God allows enemies to oppress them</li>
                <li>Israel cries out to God</li>
                <li>God raises up a judge to deliver them</li>
                <li>Peace while the judge lives</li>
                <li>The judge dies, cycle repeats</li>

            </div>
            <p>The book ends with horrific stories of violence, idolatry, and moral confusion. Israel has become as bad as the Canaanites they were supposed to drive out. They desperately need a king.</p>

            <h2>Israel Demands a King</h2>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>The people come to Samuel the prophet: "Give us a king to lead us, such as all the other nations have." This breaks God's heart - HE is supposed to be their king! But they want to be like everyone else.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">God warns them that a human king will take their sons for his army, their daughters for his palace, their best fields, and tax them heavily. But they insist: "We want a king!"</p>

            <h2>Saul: The King Who Failed</h2>
            <p>God gives them Saul - tall, handsome, impressive. He starts well but soon reveals his true heart. He partially obeys God's commands, makes excuses, and cares more about people's opinions than God's.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Samuel's response: "To obey is better than sacrifice... Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you as king."</p>

            <h2>A Shepherd Boy Becomes King</h2>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>God sends Samuel to Jesse's house to anoint the next king. Jesse parades seven impressive sons before Samuel, but God rejects them all. "The Lord does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart."</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Finally, they call in the youngest - David, who's out watching sheep. When Samuel sees him, God says, "Rise and anoint him; this is the one." David is "a man after God's own heart."</p>

            <h2>The Giant-Slayer</h2>
            <p>Before becoming king, David faces Goliath - a 9-foot giant. While trained soldiers cower, this teenage shepherd boy declares: "You come against me with sword and spear... but I come against you in the name of the Lord Almighty!"</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">David kills Goliath with a single stone. <span class="highlight">This pictures how Jesus, the son of David, would defeat our greatest enemy with what seemed like weakness.</span></p>

            <h2>God's Covenant with David 📜</h2>
            <p>After David becomes king and brings peace to Israel, God makes an incredible promise:</p>
            <div class="scripture">
                "Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever."
                <br><em>- 2 Samuel 7:16</em>
            </div>
            <p>How can a human throne last forever? <span class="highlight">This is another promise pointing to Jesus, the eternal King!</span></p>

        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">17/87</div>
            <h2>Even David Falls</h2>
            <p>David, the man after God's heart, commits terrible sins - adultery with Bathsheba and murder of her husband. When confronted, David repents deeply (read Psalm 51), and God forgives him.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">But there are consequences. His family is torn apart by violence and rebellion. Even the best human king is deeply flawed. We need a perfect King.</p>

            <div class="story-text">
                <p>David's son Solomon becomes king. When God offers him anything, Solomon asks for wisdom. God is pleased and gives him wisdom, plus riches and honor.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Solomon builds the magnificent temple in Jerusalem. When it's dedicated, God's glory fills the temple so powerfully that the priests can't even stand to minister!</p>

            <h2>Solomon's Heart Turns Away</h2>
            <p>Despite his wisdom, Solomon marries 700 wives and 300 concubines - many from nations God had forbidden. They turn his heart after other gods. The wisest man who ever lived becomes a fool through disobedience.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">God announces judgment: "I will tear the kingdom away from you."</p>

            <h2>The Kingdom Splits in Two</h2>
            <p>After Solomon dies, his son Rehoboam foolishly threatens to make the people's burden even heavier. Ten tribes rebel and form the northern kingdom (Israel). Only Judah and Benjamin remain loyal to David's line.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">From this point on, God's people are divided. Most kings are wicked. The northern kingdom doesn't have a single good king!</p>

            <h2>The Northern Kingdom Falls</h2>
            <p>In 722 BC, after centuries of idolatry, the northern kingdom of Israel is conquered by Assyria. The ten tribes are scattered among the nations and largely lost to history.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">This is God's judgment for breaking the covenant. But what about Judah in the south?</p>

            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Judah lasts longer and has some good kings who bring revival. But eventually they too fall into idolatry. In 586 BC, Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquers Jerusalem.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The unthinkable happens: The temple - God's dwelling place - is destroyed. The ark disappears. The city walls are torn down. The best and brightest are carried off to Babylon. It seems like God's promises have failed.</p>

            <h2>But God Speaks Through Prophets! 📢</h2>
            <p>Even in exile, God sends prophets with messages of hope:</p>

                <li><strong>Isaiah:</strong> A virgin will bear a son called Immanuel</li>
                <li><strong>Jeremiah:</strong> God will make a New Covenant written on hearts</li>

                "He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering... he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed."
                <br><em>- Isaiah 53:3,5 (written 700 years before Jesus)</em>
            </div>
            <p>Isaiah sees a servant who will suffer and die for the people's sins. This doesn't match their expectations of a conquering Messiah!</p>

            <p>After 70 years, Persia conquers Babylon. King Cyrus allows the Jews to return and rebuild the temple. A small remnant returns under Zerubbabel, Ezra, and Nehemiah.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">They rebuild the temple, but it's not as glorious. They rebuild the walls, but they're still under foreign rule. There's no king on David's throne. Something greater is still needed.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">They're trying to keep the law, waiting for the Messiah, longing for freedom. Many expect a political liberator to overthrow Rome. The stage is set for God's ultimate answer to the problem of sin...</p>

                "The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!"
                <br><em>- Mark 1:15</em>
            </div>
            <p>Jesus isn't just teaching about God's kingdom - He's announcing that the kingdom has arrived in HIM!</p>

            <h2>Calling Ordinary People</h2>
            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Jesus begins calling disciples - not from the religious elite but from ordinary workers. Peter, Andrew, James, and John are fishermen. Matthew is a despised tax collector. Simon is a political zealot.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">To fishermen He says, "Come, follow me, and I will send you out to fish for people." They immediately leave their nets. This tells us something crucial: Jesus doesn't call the qualified; He qualifies the called!</p>

                <br><em>- Matthew 5:17</em>
            </div>
            <p>Jesus makes God's standards even higher - it's not just about actions but about the heart. This makes the law impossible to keep on our own!</p>

            <h2>Jesus the Master Teacher 📖</h2>
            <p>Jesus teaches mainly through parables - simple stories with profound spiritual truths. He uses everyday images: seeds, soil, bread, sheep, coins, weddings.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Why parables? They reveal truth to humble seekers while concealing it from proud skeptics. They invite us to see God's kingdom with new eyes - where the last are first, the humble are exalted, and love conquers all.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Remember Jeremiah's prophecy about a New Covenant written on hearts? It's happening! Jesus is the true Passover Lamb whose blood delivers us from a greater bondage than Egypt!</p>

            <p>In Gethsemane, Jesus prays: "Father, if it is possible, may this cup be taken from me. Yet not as I will, but as you will." He's in such agony that His sweat is like drops of blood.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">What's in this cup? The full wrath of God against all human sin. Jesus, who has never sinned, is about to become sin for us.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The crowd chooses Barabbas (a murderer) to go free instead of Jesus. <span class="highlight">We are Barabbas - guilty and deserving death, but Jesus takes our place!</span></p>
