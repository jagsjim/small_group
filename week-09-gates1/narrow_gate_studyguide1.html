    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Highlight sentence:</strong> The Christian life must be entered intentionally through repentance and faithâ€”not accidentally through family heritage, church attendance, or repeating a prayerâ€”because Jesus said the gate is narrow and hard to find.

    <div class="main-points">
        <h3>Main Points:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Jesus concludes the Sermon on the Mount with four contrasts: two gates, two paths, two crowds, and two destinationsâ€”and it's an either/or proposition, not a mix-and-match situation.</li>
            
            <li>The Christian life must be entered intentionally through repentance and faith. Saying "I've been a Christian all my life" is a theological impossibility because you're born in sin, not born again.</li>
            
            <li>Modern gospel presentations make Christianity sound easy ("just pray this prayer"), but Jesus said the gate is narrow and hard to find, requiring genuine repentance and faith.</li>
            
            <li>The Christian life must be lived purposefully on a hard path marked by persecution, not an easy road of comfort and prosperity.</li>
            
            <li>We must test ourselves to see if we're truly in the faith, because there's not just an entrance but also a wayâ€”a road and a life to be lived.</li>

        <h3>Segment Questions</h3>
        
        <p><span class="timestamp">[19:26]</span> Think about your own "entrance" into Christianityâ€”can you point to a specific time when you intentionally turned from sin and trusted in Jesus, or have you just always assumed you were a Christian?</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Have you ever met someone who claimed to be a Christian because they "go to church every week" or were "raised in a Christian home"? How would you lovingly challenge that thinking?</li>
            
            <li>What's the difference between someone who "means it" when they pray a sinner's prayer versus someone who has truly repented and believed?</li>

        <h2>Transcript (Outline Format)</h2>
        
        <h3>Introduction: The Context of the Sermon on the Mount (0:02)</h3>
        <p><strong>1.1</strong> Beginning with Matthew chapter 5 and verse 1, we've seen the Beatitudes that give us a picture of Kingdom citizens and what they look like.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.2</strong> After the Beatitudes we have the picture of us as Salt and Light that lets us know what believers are in their distinct characteristics compared to the rest of the world and culture at large.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.3</strong> Immediately thereafter we get to these six antitheses where we hear basically the same phrase repeated over and over again: "You have heard it said but I say to you."</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.4</strong> In these six antitheses Jesus is teaching his people here's what Kingdom citizens look like as it relates to the law of God.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.5</strong> Being a citizen of the Kingdom raises things to an entirely different level as it relates to the law of God.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.6</strong> After the six antitheses we began to look at issues of practical religionâ€”how do you practice the religion of Christianity within the context of the Kingdom? He talks about prayer, about fasting, about giving.</p>
        
        <p><strong>1.7</strong> Then we come to the end of chapter six where he talks about our anxiety, and the beginning of chapter seven we have this statement about judging where he lays the foundation for what judging ought to be.</p>
        
        <h3>Jesus Comes to His Crucial Point (2:24)</h3>
        <p><strong>2.1</strong> Here we come to the end of the sermon on the mountâ€”chapter seven is the last chapter, it's the end of The Sermon on the Mount.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.2</strong> As Jesus brings this message to a close he is about to come to his crucial point.</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.3</strong> Listen to what Martin Lloyd Jones says about this last section: "In effect is the character of this Kingdom which I am forming, that is the type of life I'm going to give you and I want you to live and manifest it."</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.4</strong> "He has not only laid down principles, he has worked them out for us in detail. Now having done that he pauses as it were and looks at this congregation and says, 'Well now there's my purpose... what are you going to do about it?'"</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.5</strong> There's no point in listening to this sermon, there is no purpose in your having followed me through all this delineation of the Christian Life if you are only going to listen. What are you going to do about it?</p>
        
        <p><strong>2.6</strong> He comes in other words to exhortation, to application and that's what we see in these last several verses of chapter seven.</p>
        
        <h3>Four Juxtapositions (3:39)</h3>
        <p><strong>3.1</strong> In this last section he gives us a series of juxtapositions.</p>
        <p><strong>3.2</strong> First, two ways and we'll look at that today.</p>
        <p><strong>3.3</strong> Secondly, there are two trees bearing two different types of fruit.</p>
        <p><strong>3.4</strong> Thirdly, there are two confessions.</p>
        <p><strong>3.5</strong> Finally, there are two builders.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.6</strong> Here's what Jesus is giving usâ€”and oftentimes here's what we think about The Sermon on the Mount: that basically Jesus is speaking to irreligious people, he's speaking to Heathen people, he's speaking to pagan people and saying here is irreligious life, here is Pagan life, and then on the other hand here is Christianity.</p>
        
        <p><strong>3.7</strong> That is not at all what Jesus is dealing with here.</p>
        
        <h3>The Real Contrast: Kingdom of Christ vs. All Other Kingdoms (4:52)</h3>
        <p><strong>4.1</strong> He did not live in a time or an era where there were many people claiming to be irreligious. He did not live in a time or an era where there were many people like in our day and age claiming to be atheists.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.2</strong> Basically what Jesus is saying is this: not that there are the irreligious people out there, the atheists out there, the pagans out there, the people who don't believe in God out there and then they're us who are Christiansâ€”that's not his point.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.3</strong> We go all the way back to chapter five when he makes this point: "Your righteousness must exceed the righteousness" not of the irreligious, not of people who don't believe in God, not of people who are out there wild and running crazyâ€”he says "your righteousness must exceed the righteousness of the Pharisees, the most religious, the most righteous people that you can conceive of."</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.4</strong> So in essence when we talk here about these juxtapositionsâ€”the two ways and the two trees and the two confessions and the two buildersâ€”Jesus is saying here's the two: on the one hand you have the kingdom of Christ, but on the other hand you have all other kingdoms that are being pursued.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.5</strong> Everyone can be put into that categoryâ€”anyone who is not pursuing the kingdom of Christ.</p>
        
        <p><strong>4.6</strong> So regardless of what kind of religion a person is practicing, if they are not practicing the religion of Christianity as laid down by Jesus Christ, especially here in The Sermon on the Mount, it is falsehood.</p>
        
        <h3>The Two Ways: Four Key Elements (6:49)</h3>
        <p><strong>5.1</strong> Look with me if you will here at these two very short verses, 13 and 14 in chapter 7. "Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few."</p>
        
        <p><strong>5.2</strong> Here it is plain and simpleâ€”the first of these four juxtapositions talking about these two ways and Jesus introduces us to four things here:</p>
        <p><strong>5.3</strong> First, two entrances.</p>
        <p><strong>5.4</strong> Secondly, two paths.</p>
        <p><strong>5.5</strong> Thirdly, two crowds.</p>
        <p><strong>5.6</strong> Finally, two destinations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>5.7</strong> All four of these are very importantâ€”there are two entrances, two paths, two crowds, and two destinations.</p>
        
        <p><strong>5.8</strong> It is an either/or proposition. Don't miss thatâ€”it's an either/or proposition. You can't have the right gate, the wrong path, the right crowd and the wrong destiny. You can't mix those up that way.</p>
        
        <p><strong>5.9</strong> It is an all or nothing proposition, not a you take parts of this and parts of that proposition.</p>
        
        <h3>Biblical Precedent for Two Ways (9:50)</h3>
        <p><strong>6.1</strong> This is familiar territory. Jesus stands here in The Sermon on the Mount and we've alluded to the fact that at many times it is almost as though he's a second Moses.</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.2</strong> Listen to what Moses says in Deuteronomy chapter 30 and verse 19: "I call Heaven and Earth to witness against you today that I have set before you life and death, blessing and curse. Therefore choose life that you and your Offspring may live."</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.3</strong> In other words Moses stands and basically says there are two ways, there are two roads, there are two entrances, there are two crowds, there are two destinations by the way, just like Jesus does here in The Sermon on the Mount.</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.4</strong> Moses doesn't say make a really good choiceâ€”no, he tells you which one to choose. Amen.</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.5</strong> Jesus doesn't say here's that one and here's this one, pick one. No, Jesus says first and foremost choose the right one, then he says by the way there are two. Amen.</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.6</strong> It's right thereâ€”look at it in verse 13: "Enter by the narrow gate." Okay, Jesus says enter by the narrow gate. Okay, by the way I need to let you know there's another gate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.7</strong> Listen to Jeremiah 21:8: "And to this people you shall say thus says the Lord: behold I set before you the way of life and the way of death." Does that sound familiar?</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.8</strong> There are two ways, two roadsâ€”one leads to life, the other leads to death. That's exactly what Jesus is saying.</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.9</strong> Isaiah chapter 53 and verse 6: "All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned everyone to his own way, and the lord has laid upon him the iniquity of us all."</p>
        
        <p><strong>6.10</strong> In other words there's a right way and a wrong way. Isaiah says problem with usâ€”we've chosen the wrong way.</p>
        
        <h3>First Element: Two Entrances - Intentional Entry Required (13:54)</h3>
        <p><strong>7.1</strong> First, there are two entrances. From the two entrances we learn this: the Christian Life must be entered into intentionally.</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.2</strong> The Christian Life must be entered into intentionally.</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.3</strong> One of the most frightening responses to a question that I have ever heard is this: you ask someone if they're a Christian and I don't even ask people this question anymore, especially here in the South, here in the Bible Belt.</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.4</strong> You get some scary stuff when you ask somebody "Are you a Christian?" "Are you a Christian? Of course I'm a Christian! I go to church every week!"</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.5</strong> Really? I'm hoping that what you mean there is "I'm a Christian and I go to church every week" or "I'm a Christian therefore I go to church every week" and not "I'm a Christian because I go to church every week."</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.6</strong> But you know as well as I doâ€”you're related to some of these folks just like meâ€”no, no, what they mean is "I'm a Christian because I go to church every week."</p>
        
        <p><strong>7.7</strong> You just want to stop and look at them and say, "Okay, here's the deal: stay out of your garage because if going to church every week will make you a Christian, eventually going to the garage will make you a car."</p>
        
        <h3>The Scariest Answer (15:17)</h3>
        <p><strong>8.1</strong> Or "Are you a Christian?" "Of course I'm a Christian, I was raised in a Christian home." Now that's not the scariest one.</p>
        
        <p><strong>8.2</strong> Here's the scariest one: "Are you a Christian?" "Yes, I've been a Christian all my life."</p>
        
        <p><strong>8.3</strong> "I've been a Christian all my life." Let me say this to you: that is a theological impossibility.</p>
        
        <p><strong>8.4</strong> The Christian Life is one that must be entered into intentionallyâ€”not accidentally, not hereditarily.</p>
        
        <p><strong>8.5</strong> It must be entered into intentionally. You have not been a Christian all your life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>8.6</strong> And I'll take it a step further: if you believe that literally, then you're probably not a Christian at all.</p>
        
        <p><strong>8.7</strong> Let me say that again: if you believe literally that you've been a Christian your whole life, I would be so bold as to say you're probably not a Christian at all.</p>
        
        <p><strong>8.8</strong> Because if you believe literally that you've been a Christian your whole life, then you have not entered into the kingdom of God intentionally through repentance and faith.</p>
        
        <h3>Jesus's Gospel Message (17:01)</h3>
        <p><strong>9.1</strong> Mark chapter 1, verses 14 and 15â€”first time we hear Jesus in Mark chapter one, what does he say?</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.2</strong> "Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God and saying..." Jesus is going to preach the gospelâ€”what is it going to sound like when Jesus preaches the gospel?</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.3</strong> "The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe in the gospel." Period. End of message.</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.4</strong> Repent and believe. Repent and believe.</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.5</strong> Listen, you were not born repentant and you were not born believing. Therefore I say again, it is a theological impossibility that you've been a Christian your whole life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.6</strong> Jesus says "Enter the narrow gate"â€”not "Don't stray away from the narrow gate that you were born into because you were born into a really good family or because you were born into a Christian culture."</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.7</strong> No, Jesus says "Enter the narrow gate." You must enter the narrow gate. You must do so intentionally. You cannot do so accidentally.</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.8</strong> In fact he makes a point at the end when he says "Those who find it are few."</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.9</strong> Few people find it. So it's not like there are folks who just kind of are walking along one day and they look up and they go "That's weird, I went through a very narrow gate. It's strange, I'm on a road with very few people. Not many. Wow, would you look at thatâ€”I'm on the way to life and not destruction."</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.10</strong> Doesn't work that way. You have to find the narrow gate, seek the narrow gate, petition God for the narrow gate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>9.11</strong> And you come through the narrow gate through repentance and faith.</p>
        
        <h3>The Doctrine of Original Sin (19:26)</h3>
        <p><strong>10.1</strong> I want you to understand something: human beings are born in sin.</p>
        
        <p><strong>10.2</strong> As a result, here's the news flash: all of us by default find the broad road, the broad gate, the wide gate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>10.3</strong> All of us by default are headed for destruction.</p>
        
        <p><strong>10.4</strong> See, one of the reasons that you have to enter into the Christian Life intentionally is because you were born heading on the broad road, heading through the wide gate, heading with the big crowd and heading for destruction.</p>
        
        <p><strong>10.5</strong> It's called the doctrine of original sin.</p>
        
        <p><strong>10.6</strong> Listen to this from the London Baptist Confession, Chapter 15, point 3, which talks about saving repentance: "This saving repentance is an evangelical grace whereby a person being by the Holy Spirit made sensible of the manifold evils of his sin doth by faith in Christ humble himself for it with godly sorrow, detestation of it and self-abhorrency, praying for pardon and strength of grace with a purpose and endeavor by supplies of the spirit to walk before God unto all well pleasing in all things."</p>
        
        <p><strong>10.7</strong> Does that sound like something you're naturally born into? Does that kind of repentance and self-abhorrency sound like something that you just kind of were graced with as a result of being born into this world?</p>
        
        <p><strong>10.8</strong> Or were you like everyone else in desperate need of a savior because you were born in sin and shaped in iniquity?</p>
        
        <p><strong>10.9</strong> Jesus says "Enter the narrow gate. You don't do it by accident."</p>
        
        <h3>False Gospel Presentations (21:43)</h3>
        <p><strong>11.1</strong> Unfortunately, there are many who proclaim the gospel who don't proclaim this truth, who make it sound easy to come in.</p>
        
        <p><strong>11.2</strong> Listen to this from James Montgomery Boice: "Many who preach the gospel today are out of step with Jesus in this matter. They may preach a gospel but they make it sound easy to become a Christian and to be saved."</p>
        
        <p><strong>11.3</strong> Anybody ever heard anything like that? "It's easy to become a Christian! It's easy as one, two, three! Here's the three steps! It's easy as ABCâ€”A: acknowledge, B: believe, C: confess. Okay, it's easy to become a Christian, just do this and repeat after me."</p>
        
        <p><strong>11.4</strong> He says they preach a gospel but they make it sound easy to become a Christian and be saved. Jesus did not.</p>
        
        <p><strong>11.5</strong> William Hendrickson had it right when he wrote: "Our Lord does not follow the method that is used by certain self-styled revivalists who speak as if getting saved is one of the easiest things in the world. Jesus on the contrary pictures entrance into the kingdom as being on the one hand most desirable, yet on the other hand not at all easy. The entrance gate is narrow, it must be found."</p>
        
        <h3>The Purpose Driven Life Gospel (22:53)</h3>
        <p><strong>12.1</strong> But that's not the gospel that we hear in our culture today, is it? The gospel that we hear in our culture today sounds a little something like this:</p>
        
        <p><strong>12.2</strong> "It's real easy! First, believe God loves you and made you for a purpose. Believe God has chosen you to have a relationship with Jesus who died on the cross for you. Believe that no matter what you've done, God wants to forgive you."</p>
        
        <p><strong>12.3</strong> "Second, receive. Receive Jesus into your life as Lord and Savior. Receive his forgiveness for your sins. So I invite you to bow your head and quietly whisper the prayer that will change your eternity."</p>
        
        <p><strong>12.4</strong> "What's that prayer? 'Jesus, I believe in you and I receive you.' If you sincerely meant that prayerâ€”'Jesus I believe in you and I receive you'â€”if you sincerely meant that prayer, congratulations! Welcome to the family of God!"</p>
        
        <p><strong>12.5</strong> That's the gospel presentationâ€”or the excuse for a gospel presentationâ€”in The Purpose Driven Life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>12.6</strong> No repentance, no gospel. No sin, no wrath of God, no nothing. Just believe God loves you, he made you for a purpose, Jesus died for you. That's it. Really? Just like that?</p>
        
        <p><strong>12.7</strong> No! Not just like that! You are a wretched, miserable, sinful creature who deserves to die and go to hell, and unless you repent of your sin, unless you are aware of the fact that you deserve to die and be crushed under the weight of the holiness and majesty of God, you don't get it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>12.8</strong> And there's none of that there. It's none of it there.</p>
        
        <h3>The Problem with "Easy" Gospel (24:53)</h3>
        <p><strong>13.1</strong> "Believe in Jesus"â€”which Jesus? He said nothing about Jesus. He hasn't defined Jesus.</p>
        
        <p><strong>13.2</strong> What if I believe in the Jesus of the New Age movement? What if I believe in the Jesus who's "lowly Jesus, meek and mild" who had never heard of hell? What if I believe in "lowly Jesus, meek and mild" who wouldn't dare send anybody to hell, let alone believe or teach that there is such a place?</p>
        
        <p><strong>13.3</strong> If I believe in that Jesus, can I be saved? The answer: no.</p>
        
        <p><strong>13.4</strong> But is that what you get in the modern proclamation of the Gospel? No, you get "it's really, really easy."</p>
        
        <p><strong>13.5</strong> No, it's not. It's not. It is incredibly difficult, and the difficulty comes because of your sin and mine.</p>
        
        <p><strong>13.6</strong> The difficulty comes because you are bent toward your own will, because I am bent toward my own will.</p>
        
        <p><strong>13.7</strong> The difficulty comes because you believe that you deserve the death of Jesus on the cross and that you were actually worthy of it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>13.8</strong> The difficulty comes because you want to follow your own life and your own path and ask God to bless it. You want Jesus to be an appendage on your self-centered life, not an eradication of it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>13.9</strong> That's why it's hard. It is not easy.</p>
        
        <h3>Second Element: Two Paths - Purposeful Living Required (26:15)</h3>
        <p><strong>14.1</strong> The first thing that we see here from Christ is that the Christian Life must be entered into intentionally. It doesn't happen by accident.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.2</strong> Your old man doesn't want to die. Your old man doesn't want to let Christ put him to death. Your old man wants to fight to live.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.3</strong> So your old man will lie to you. Your old man will say things like "don't enter the narrow gateâ€”why should you? There are a whole bunch of other people over here and they talk about Jesus and they go to church. They don't have that narrow gate theology."</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.4</strong> Can't say "Amen"? You ought to say "Ouch."</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.5</strong> In fact, "narrow"â€”that's negative in itself, isn't it? You don't want to be narrow.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.6</strong> Maybe you all don't hear this stuffâ€”I hear it everywhere I go: "That's so narrow!"</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.7</strong> Yes, actually it is narrow. That's the gospel. God's not running for office. He can afford to be narrow. The gate is narrow.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.8</strong> The Christian Life must be entered into intentionallyâ€”it does not happen by accident.</p>
        
        <p><strong>14.9</strong> Secondly, not only are there two entrances, there are two paths. But what do we see there with the two paths? The Christian Life must be lived purposefully.</p>
        
        <h3>The Problem with Modern Church Practices (28:17)</h3>
        <p><strong>15.1</strong> Again, there are those who try to separate justification and sanctification in such a way that we actually believe that a person can be saved and not have their life affected at all.</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.2</strong> Jesus says it's not only a gateâ€”there's a path involved here, there's a way involved here, there's a lifestyle involved here.</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.3</strong> See, here's the other problem with the way the gospel is presented in our current culture: the problem is you manipulate people half the time, don't even preach the gospel.</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.4</strong> I'm at a church not long agoâ€”it was actually a conference of our convention, I'll just go ahead and say that, put it out there. It was a big huge Southern Baptist meeting with a bunch of Southern Baptist pastors.</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.5</strong> I got there a little early so I went to the host churchâ€”ginormous church, just big for no reason at all, big huge, just trying, just big, okay? Like 5,000 seats in the place or something like that.</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.6</strong> I go in and that night the guy's preaching and he's actually preaching on tithing because the building was new and really needed to be paid for, you know, and so he was preaching on tithing. I mean just preaching hard, he's thundering away on tithing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.7</strong> And after he finishes thundering away on tithing, they come to the end of the service and you're not a good Baptist unless at the end of the service you do a manipulative, arm-twisting altar call.</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.8</strong> So he's preached on tithing, hadn't mentioned Christ not one time in his whole sermon, but he gets to the end of the message and they start to play the soft music and he looks out and he says, "There are any of you out there and you've never come to God through faith in his son Jesus Christ, you just need to repeat this prayer after me."</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.9</strong> I almost got whiplash! Where did that come from? Where did we get that?</p>
        
        <p><strong>15.10</strong> And here's the other thing: people start walking to the front, and I'm going "Where are they going and why? There's been no gospel preached! There's been nothing about Jesus, nothing about sin, nothing about repentance, nothing aboutâ€”but they feel guilty because they haven't been giving and now they want to come to the cross."</p>
        
        <h3>The Sinner's Prayer Problem (30:14)</h3>
        <p><strong>16.1</strong> What do they come into? They come to the front, they're led in the sinner's prayer that you will find nowhere in the Bibleâ€”nowhere in the Bible.</p>
        
        <p><strong>16.2</strong> And right afterwards that statement is made: "Welcome to the family of God! If you prayed that prayer and you meant it, you're saved!"</p>
        
        <p><strong>16.3</strong> I've even heard it done this way: "Right here, right now, if you got your Bible with you, take out a pen, you write your name down on the front cover and you write down this date, because this is the date when your name was sealed in the Lamb's Book of Life!"</p>
        
        <p><strong>16.4</strong> Really? Really? Because you repeated somebody else's words?</p>
        
        <p><strong>16.5</strong> Oh boy, waitâ€”the caveat: "and meant it." Really? Really? Because I know a whole lot of people who prayed that prayer and meant it, and the fruit of their lifeâ€”which we're going to talk about laterâ€”the fruit of their life says they lied.</p>
        
        <p><strong>16.6</strong> Did they mean it? Yes. But what is it? Well, I don't know. If somebody says "basically you can die and go to hell or you can pray this prayer after me," if you really don't want to go to hell, will you pray that and mean it? Sure! If you don't want to go to a fiery place, absolutely I'll pray the prayer and I'll mean it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>16.7</strong> "Jesus, I'm sorry... Jesus, forgive me... Jesus, I invite you into my heart..." Did you pray that prayer? Yep. Did you mean it? Yeah, I meant it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>16.8</strong> A few more questions: Do you know who the Jesus is to whom you just prayed? Because you can mean it and not know who Jesus is.</p>
        
        <p><strong>16.9</strong> Did you mean it because you're really scared right now, or because you've been born again and brought to a place of conviction and brokenness over your sin? You can mean it for a lot of reasons, folks.</p>
        
        <h3>Testing Yourself (32:25)</h3>
        <p><strong>17.1</strong> One of the things that you're not going to find here, one of the things that we're not going to do here, is ever tell you that because you did this, you're a member of the kingdom of God.</p>
        
        <p><strong>17.2</strong> No, the Bible says "Test yourselves to see if you be in the faith." Test yourself.</p>
        
        <p><strong>17.3</strong> There's not just an entrance, there's also a way. There is a road. There is a life to be lived.</p>
        
        <h3>The Hard Way Involves Persecution (32:51)</h3>
        <p><strong>18.1</strong> There's a couple of things here that we find. Here's oneâ€”it's very interesting: there are two different words that are used for the narrow gate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>18.2</strong> Rather than do Greek lessons here, let me just share this with you: both of the words can be translated "narrow," but one he translates as "hard"â€”"the way is hard."</p>
        
        <p><strong>18.3</strong> There are a couple ways that you can translate thatâ€”you can translate it as a way that's hard, or you can also translate it as a way that is compressed, or pressed in, or harassed.</p>
        
        <p><strong>18.4</strong> But the word that "hard" is derived from in the Greek is almost always a word that's translated to mean persecution.</p>
        
        <p><strong>18.5</strong> So in essence, here's what Jesus says: those who enter into my kingdom enter a gate that is narrow and a life that is filled with hardship and persecution.</p>
        
        <p><strong>18.6</strong> How about that?</p>
        
        <h3>Contrast with Modern Gospel (34:16)</h3>
        <p><strong>19.1</strong> What does the gospel of our day say? The gospel of our day says if your life is hard and there's persecution in your life, you need Jesus so that your life won't be hard and that you won't have persecution in your life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>19.2</strong> While Paul says in 2 Timothy 3:12: "All those who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus shall be persecuted."</p>
        
        <p><strong>19.3</strong> Not only that, but look at these other passages in Matthew. Look for example in Matthew 5:10-12: "Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven."</p>
        
        <p><strong>19.4</strong> Here's what's interesting: he says you're blessed if you're persecuted for righteousness' sake. Why? Because that's evidence that yours is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
        
        <p><strong>19.5</strong> How is that evidence that yours is the kingdom of heaven? News flash: in chapter 7, at the close of the sermonâ€”this is the beginning of the sermonâ€”beginning of the sermon he says you're blessed if you're persecuted for righteousness' sake because yours is the kingdom of heaven.</p>
        
        <p><strong>19.6</strong> At the end of the sermon he says enter the narrow gate, the gate that is filled with persecution and hardship. Why? Because the end of that one is life, or the kingdom of heaven.</p>
        
        <p><strong>19.7</strong> He's restating what was already communicated in the first part of his sermon. He comes to the close of the sermon and brings you all the way back to the beginning: enter the narrow gate, enter the hard life, the life filled with persecution and suffering.</p>
        
        <h3>More Biblical Evidence (35:57)</h3>
        <p><strong>20.1</strong> Look at what it says in verse 11: "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account"â€”not just because you're a nasty person who deserves it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>20.2</strong> By the way, if we can just put that footnote there: if you're a nasty person who deserves bad things to be said about you, don't turn that around as evidence that you're on the right road.</p>
        
        <p><strong>20.3</strong> We get that, okay? All right. "Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you."</p>
        
        <p><strong>20.4</strong> Look at chapter 5, verse 44: "But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you."</p>
        
        <p><strong>20.5</strong> Look at chapter 10, verses 16 through 23: "Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles."</p>
        
        <p><strong>20.6</strong> "When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you."</p>
        
        <p><strong>20.7</strong> "Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death, and you will be hated by all for my name's sake."</p>
        
        <p><strong>20.8</strong> "But the one who endures to the end will be saved."</p>
