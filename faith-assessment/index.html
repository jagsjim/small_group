  <h1>Faith Assessment</h1>

  <div class="disclaimer">
    <strong>üõ°Ô∏è Please read before beginning:</strong>
    <p>This assessment is <strong>NOT</strong> about earning salvation through good performance. Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.</p>
    <p>If this assessment reveals areas of concern, that's GOOD‚Äîit may mean the Holy Spirit is working in your heart. It could reveal that you need true salvation for the first time, or that you have a wrong understanding of what biblical Christianity actually looks like.</p>
    <p>You cannot fix yourself or make yourself more saved. Only God can change hearts. The goal isn't to make you feel like a failure, but to help you see whether your heart has been truly transformed by God's grace and whether you understand what genuine faith looks like.</p>
    <p>If you realize you need a heart change, cry out to Jesus‚ÄîHe loves to save!</p>
    <p><em>Note:</em> The multiple-choice answers might not fully capture everyone's exact thoughts or beliefs. That's totally normal. These tools are like a rough sketch, not a detailed portrait. Just pick the closest answer that fits your view.</p>
