  <p>üõ°Ô∏è This assessment is NOT about earning salvation through good performance. Salvation is by grace alone, through faith alone, in Christ alone.

If this assessment reveals areas of concern, that's GOOD - it means the Holy Spirit may be working in your heart. This could reveal that you need true salvation for the first time, OR that you have a wrong understanding of what biblical Christianity actually looks like.

You cannot fix yourself or make yourself more saved. Only God can change hearts. The goal isn't to make you feel like a failure, but to help you see whether your heart has been truly transformed by God's grace, and whether you understand what genuine faith looks like.

If you realize you need a heart change, cry out to Jesus - He loves to save!</p>
