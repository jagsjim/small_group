        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p><strong>Grumbling and complaining might seem like small sins, but they reveal our deepest heart issues and rob us of the joy God intends for His children.</strong></p>
        
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Paul commands us to do all things without grumbling or disputing.</strong> This isn't just about external complaintsâ€”it includes the internal thoughts where we dispute with God about how He's running our lives.</li>
            
            <li><strong>This command connects directly to Jesus's example of humble service.</strong> Jesus suffered without opening His mouth to complain, even when He was oppressed and afflicted.</li>
            
            <li><strong>"Disputing" means the evil thoughts that rise up in our minds against God.</strong> It's like having an inner lawyer that gets in God's face and argues that He shouldn't be treating us this way.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Being grumble-free isn't marginal to the Christian lifeâ€”it's central.</strong> Paul demonstrates this throughout Philippians, showing contentment in prison, joy when others preach from wrong motives, and counting all loss as rubbish compared to knowing Christ.</li>
            
            <li><strong>When we don't grumble, we shine as lights in a dark world.</strong> A crooked and twisted generation is full of murmuring, complaining, and anger, so Christians who rejoice instead of grumble become incredibly bright.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Jesus taught that we are the light of the world, especially when we rejoice in suffering.</strong> When people revile and persecute us, our response should be joy and gladness because our reward is great in heaven.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Good works alone don't bring glory to Godâ€”it's the spirit behind them that matters.</strong> When we do good deeds with joy in the midst of suffering, people have no categories for that kind of response.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Joy in suffering is what makes Christians otherworldly bright.</strong> In a world riddled with dissatisfaction, anger, and retaliation, joyful believers become compelling witnesses that point people to God.</li>

        <h2>Transcript (Outline Format)</h2>
        
        <h3>Video 1: Can the Godly Grumble?</h3>
        
        <h4>1. The Command Against Grumbling <span class="timestamp">(0:04)</span></h4>
        <p>We come now to Philippians chapter 2 and the paragraph made up of verses 14 to 18, and what we're going to focus on in this session. We'll be on this paragraph for quite a few sessions. Grumbling and disputingâ€”how important is that? Is that central to the book or is that just an aside?</p>
        
        <p>Let's read it: "Do all things without grumbling or disputing that you may be blameless and innocent children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast the Word of Life so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me."</p>
        
        <p>Father, this is stunning. We are so prone to grumble and dispute, murmur, think evil thoughts, complain. Oh God, use this text to make us brighter in this dark world by making us murmur-free. I ask this in Jesus' name. Amen.</p>
        
        <h4>1.1 Connection to Previous Commands</h4>
        <p>There is no connector like a "because" or "therefore" to what just went before. They may leave the section "work out your salvation with fear and trembling," and the absence of any connector and just the immediate command to "do all things without grumbling" inclines me to think that the way Paul is thinking is: this is a way of doing verses 12 and 13, namely working out your salvation. You remember all that we said about thatâ€”effecting, bringing about, making real your salvation in life. So here's a concrete path of doing that, namely do all things without grumbling.</p>
        
        <h4>1.2 The Context of Humble Service</h4>
        <p>Did he have something specific in mind to focus on with this "all things"? I don't want to limit it, but I think since just before verses 12 through 13 there were these commands in verses 3 through 8, it would be good to bring them into focus again. So just before he talked about every knee bowing before Jesus and him being exalted above every name, he had said, "Do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourself." So there's a huge command to count others as worthy of your service.</p>
        
        <p>"Let each of you look not only to his own interestsâ€”don't be selfish, don't be ingrown, don't think that only you countâ€”but also to the interests of others."</p>
        
        <p>So those two huge commands: take others' interest into account and count them more significant than yourself. And then he uses Jesus as an example. "Have this mind"â€”and that's the mind he was talking aboutâ€”and now he describes it the way Jesus lived it. "Have this mind among yourselves which was yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself." <strong>Do that without murmuring.</strong> "Taking the form of a servant." <strong>Do that without murmuring.</strong> "Being born in the likeness of man." Get down low with men <strong>without murmuring.</strong> "Being found in human form he humbled himself." <strong>Do that without murmuring.</strong> "Becoming obedient." <strong>Do that without murmuring.</strong> "To the point of death, yes even the death on the cross." Be willing to die <strong>without murmuring.</strong></p>
        
        <h4>2. Jesus's Example of No Grumbling <span class="timestamp">(5:00)</span></h4>
        <p>So I think "all things" here does mean all things, but he's thinking most immediately about: be people of lowly, humble, other-oriented service and ministry. Do that without grumbling.</p>
        
        <p>Since the example of Jesus was foremost here, that calls to mind the fact that when Jesus was prophesied as coming to suffer like that, it says, "He was oppressed and he was afflicted"â€”this is Isaiah 53â€”"yet he opened not his mouth. He didn't murmur, he didn't complain, like a lamb that was led to the slaughter, like a sheep before its shearers is silent, he opened not his mouth." So Jesus did not complain in his ministry of suffering, and we shouldn't either.</p>
        
        <p>Here's Jesus being described again in 1 Peter 2: "He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled he did not revile. He didn't open his mouth and complain or criticize or dispute. When he suffered he didn't threaten, but he kept on trusting himself to him who judges justly."</p>
        
        <h4>3. Understanding "Disputing" <span class="timestamp">(7:00)</span></h4>
        <p>We've been assuming "disputing" hereâ€”what does that mean? Why does he say "disputing"? That seems like an odd word. Dispute with whom? The word here in Greek is simply "thoughts," sometimes translated "evil thoughts," sometimes translated "quarreling," which is why "disputing" is used here.</p>
        
        <p>If you say, "Okay, without grumbling or thoughts," that doesn't make sense unless you qualify the thought. So you'd have to say "evil thoughts," and then you'd have to say, "Well, what kind of evil thoughts? What's evil about them?" And the answer would be: <strong>they are thoughts that dispute with God.</strong> "God, what are you doing? God, why am I suffering this?"</p>
        
        <p>This disputing here is first in the head. It's not first with anybody. He's not talking about any debate here. He's simply talking about what goes on in your thoughts when you're about to verbally grumble. What goes on is criticism and indictment, and <strong>your inner lawyer is getting in God's face and saying he shouldn't be treating you this way or people shouldn't be treating you this way.</strong></p>
        
        <h4>4. The Centrality of This Command <span class="timestamp">(8:34)</span></h4>
        <p>Now here's my only other question: how central is this? "Do all things without murmuring."</p>
        
        <p>In Philippians 1:25-28 we read: "Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy of faith." So Paul's going to stay on the planet to bring about the joy of faith, and the joy of faith would be the opposite of the complaining of faith, the murmuring of faith.</p>
        
        <h4>4.1 Examples Throughout Philippians</h4>
        <p>Chapter 4, verses 11-13: "Not that I'm speaking of being in need, for I've learned in whatever situation I am to be content." That's the opposite of murmuring, complaining. "I know how to be brought low and not grumble. I know how to abound and not grumble. In any and every circumstance I've learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger without grumbling, abundance and need without grumbling. I can do all things without grumbling through him who strengthens me." This is not marginalâ€”this is at the center of Paul's concerns.</p>
        
        <p>Chapter 3, verses 7-8: "Whatever gain I had I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish in order that I might gain Christ." In other words, all the loss in life is rubbish compared to having Christ. <strong>Nothing will take away murmuring like saying to every loss that comes, "I'm not going to murmur. I'm not going to grumble and complain and indict God. I have Jesus and he is worth everything to me."</strong></p>
        
        <h4>5. Conclusion <span class="timestamp">(13:08)</span></h4>
        <p>This book is all about conquering grumbling. It is. It's all about conquering grumbling because when we conquer grumbling, look: "that you may be blameless and innocent." You're going to be free from grumbling, free from disputing, you're going to be blameless and innocent children of God in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation. All they do is murmur and grumble and complain. Among whom you therefore don't do that and shine. This is the light of the world. We're going to talk about that in the sessions to come. <strong>Being free from grumbling through faith in Christ is not marginal.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>Video 2: Grumble-Free for His Glory</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Introduction to Light Connection <span class="timestamp">(0:05)</span></h4>
        <p>This is our fourth session on the paragraph Philippians 2:14-18, and I have one very short question today. It's a suggestion that I'm going to make to you that I've not heard anybody else make, and so take it with a grain of salt. Say Piper might be quirky here, but I want to show you what I see in comparing what Jesus said about the light of the world and what Paul is saying about shining as lights in the world.</p>
        
        <p>So he says here, "Do all things without grumbling," so be a person so amazingly content in God's sovereign care over you and his ruling of the world and he's turning everything for good that you don't complain, and thoughts don't arise in your mind to cause you just to dispute with God and the way he does things and how difficult things can become. Grumbling is gone, disputing in your mind with God is gone.</p>
        
        <p>Why should you do all things that way? "So that you may be blameless and innocent children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation among whom you shine." You do this so that you'll shine. You'll appear as lights in the cosmos. This is literally stars in the cosmos, lights in the world.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Jesus's Teaching on Light in Matthew 5 <span class="timestamp">(1:59)</span></h4>
        <p>So I'm going to the classic passage here in Matthew 5:11-16: "Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad." So in the midst of being reviled and being persecuted and having all kinds of evil spoken against youâ€”and remember back in Philippians 1:27-28, these folks are being opposed, they have opponents, adversaries, and when they are fearless towards those adversaries, remember, they are a sign of their destruction.</p>
        
        <h4>2.1 Joy Replaces Grumbling</h4>
        <p>Now if anything is going to cast out grumbling, it's going to be joy. If anything could be the opposite of "I'm grumbling when you revile me, I'm gonna grumble when you persecute me, I'm gonna grumble when you say all kinds of evil against me, and I'm gonna have all kinds of thoughts rise up in my head about why God shouldn't allow my life to be made so miserable by all these opponents"â€”no, no. Jesus says you rejoice when that happens.</p>
        
        <p><strong>That's simply a staggering miracle. You don't see it very often. This is why it's so bright in the world, I think.</strong></p>
        
        <h4>3. The Light of the World <span class="timestamp">(4:49)</span></h4>
        <p>"You are the light of the world." He said, "You are the salt of the earth," but here, "You are the light of the world." Now my question isâ€”and I haven't seen people make this connectionâ€”don't you think that if you were to try to figure out in what sense this section here is intended to be interpreted, what makes a person bright in a dark world, a dark world of reviling and persecution and slander, wouldn't the brightest thing in the world be that in the midst of that suffering Christians are rejoicing? Christians are glad people. Christians have their hearts so set on heaven that in this world they can endure anything. Wouldn't that be bright?</p>
        
        <h4>4. Good Works with the Right Spirit <span class="timestamp">(6:23)</span></h4>
        <p>So you might say, "Oh, it's good works, it's not this." But listen: there are thousands of people who do good works and nobody gives glory to God. Are there not? Unbelievers do good works, nominal Christians do good works, all kinds of people do good works, and nobody gives glory to God. They praise them, they write articles about them, they put them on TV shows, they may write biographiesâ€”they don't give any glory to God at all.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Good works alone don't direct attention to God.</strong> There's got to be a spirit about these works. There's got to be a flavor to these works. Something makes these works otherworldly so that glory goes to God. And I'm arguing it's this: <strong>it's when you do good deeds with joy and gladness in the midst of suffering.</strong></p>
        
        <p>People, they have no categories for that, right? And they would be inclined to say, "Whoa, where does that come from?"</p>
        
        <h4>5. Conclusion: Shining in a Dark World <span class="timestamp">(7:43)</span></h4>
        <p>And what I'm suggesting is that when Paul says here, "Get rid of grumbling, get rid of disputing in your head, replace it with rejoicing and being glad, for great is your reward in heaven because you're the children of God," just like Matthew 5:12 said, "replace it with joy," if you do that, these crooked and twisted people who are persecuting you and slandering you will see you shining in their dark, grumble-complaining-filled, anger-filled, retaliation-filled world, and they won't have any categories for why you would do good to them and rejoice when they are treating you so badly.</p>
        
        <p><strong>So you can see perhaps why I think getting rid of grumbling and disputing in the midst of a context of suffering would be unbelievably compelling brightness in a world that is just riddled with dissatisfaction and anger and retaliation.</strong></p>
