    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <div class="summary-intro">
        <p><strong>God wants you to delight in Him as a person, not just obey Him out of duty—and this delight is actually your highest calling.</strong></p>
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-point">
        <strong>1.</strong> The book of Job shows the difference between loving God and loving His gifts. Satan claimed Job only loved God because of his blessings, but Job proved you can treasure God even when everything else is taken away.
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-point">
        <strong>2.</strong> Enjoying God means enjoying a person, not just ideas or rules. Ultimate reality is a person who has always existed, and the Bible calls us to delight in Him personally.
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-point">
        <strong>3.</strong> We get to know God through His actions and the good things He creates. Everything good in life—honey, bread, friendship, love—is designed to give us a taste of what God is like.
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-point">
        <strong>4.</strong> Think of the best people you know, then imagine all their wonderful qualities perfected and combined in one person. That gives you a hint of what it's like to enjoy God.
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-point">
        <strong>5.</strong> Delighting in God is your highest duty because Jesus said the greatest commandment is to love God with all your heart. Love starts with the heart preferring and delighting, which then leads to actions.
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-point">
        <strong>6.</strong> You cannot truly love other people unless your love overflows from joy in God. The Macedonians showed authentic love through their generosity, which came from abundant joy despite poverty and suffering.
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-point">
        <strong>7.</strong> God is most glorified when you are most satisfied in Him. Just like a spouse feels treasured when you find joy in spending time with them, God feels glorified when you genuinely enjoy Him.
    </div>

    <div class="numbered-point">
        <strong>8.</strong> Don't approach God out of mere duty—come to Him because you can't help yourself. God wants you to ring His doorbell with excitement, not obligation.
    </div>

    <h2>Segment Questions (with Timestamps)</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p><span class="timestamp">[17:11]</span> Have you ever had something really good taken away from you—like a relationship, job, or dream? What was your honest reaction toward God in that moment?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><span class="timestamp">[35:00]</span> Have you ever felt like you were just going through the motions with God instead of actually wanting to follow Him?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><span class="timestamp">[42:07]</span> How do you see joy in God overflowing into how you treat other people? Or is that connection missing in your life right now?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Overview Questions</h2>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>1.</strong> How will you remind yourself this week that God wants your joy, not just your duty?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>2.</strong> What's one area where you might be valuing a "gift" from God more than God Himself?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="question">
        <p><strong>3.</strong> What would it look like for you to "ring God's doorbell" with excitement instead of obligation?</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Transcript</h2>

    <h3><span class="section-number">1.</span> Introduction: The Danger of Speaking Truth Wrongly <span class="timestamp">(0:00)</span></h3>

    <h4><span class="section-number">1.1</span> Eliphaz's true but wrongly applied words:</h4>
    <p>"If you lay gold in the dust, then the Almighty will be your gold. For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God." Those are the words of Eliphaz as he was a friend of Job. Job had lost in death all of his 10 children. He had lost either through death or being stolen all of his livestock. His wife had turned against God. And now Eliphaz and Bildad and Zophar, his three friends, had come and they had sat with him in sackcloth and ashes and in silence for seven days. And now they are speaking.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">1.2</span> God's anger at Eliphaz:</h4>
    <p>When Job's trial was over—chapter 42—when his trial was over, this is what God said to Eliphaz: "The Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite: 'My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.'" Well, what could be more right, more beautiful than to say, "If you lay gold in the dust, the Almighty will be your gold and you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God"? I regard that sentence as true, right, beautiful. And when Eliphaz spoke it, God was angry at him.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">1.3</span> The problem with Eliphaz's approach:</h4>
    <p>What's wrong is that Eliphaz used those words to indict Job. Verse 23, just before those verses: "If you, Job, if you return to the Almighty"—assuming he's not with him—"if you return to the Almighty, you will be built up. If you remove injustice far from you." So Eliphaz and his friends cannot conceive that there could be a man of justice and a man who values God above gold who suffers this much. They can't imagine those two things—this much suffering and valuing God above gold and being a man of justice—they can't go together in one person. And they're dead wrong. God is angry that they would talk to Job that way.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">1.4</span> Warning to listeners:</h4>
    <p>It is possible for a preacher to speak truth about God in a way that makes God angry. You get that? I want to heighten your vigilance as you listen. I want you to realize that every time you hear someone speak, true things may be mingled with false things. True things may be spoken with half-truths. True things may come from a proud and unloving heart. True things may be spoken in cruel ways. True things may be spoken out of balance so there's no proportion in what's being said with what's real. It is possible for a preacher to speak truth in a way that makes God angry.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">1.5</span> Call for discernment:</h4>
    <p>When you lift your hands in passionate worship at this event, you're not being asked—not by Louie, not by David Crowder, not by me or anybody else—to turn your brain off while you feel deeply. Rather, you are being summoned to turn your brain on. Think of those lyrics: "Is that true? If that's true, I'm gonna feel it with all my heart. And if it's not, I'm not playing this game"—whether it's Piper speaking or anybody's singing.</p>

    <h3><span class="section-number">2.</span> Two Questions About Delighting in God <span class="timestamp">(8:02)</span></h3>

    <h4><span class="section-number">2.1</span> The truth of Eliphaz's statement:</h4>
    <p>We know it's true because it's all over the Bible: "If you lay gold in the dust, the Almighty will be your gold, and you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God."</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">2.2</span> Two main questions:</h4>
    <div class="subsection">
        <p><strong>2.2.1</strong> What is it like to delight in God?</p>
        <p><strong>2.2.2</strong> Is that delight your highest duty?</p>
    </div>

    <h4><span class="section-number">2.3</span> Rephrasing the questions:</h4>
    <p>What is the actual experience of enjoying God? What is it—finding pleasure in God, being satisfied in God? And the reason I ask the question is because I think many believers know how to enjoy pizza. They know how to enjoy football. They know how to enjoy friends. They know how to enjoy sex. And you put that word "enjoy" or "delight" or "be satisfied" onto God and they just—that means nothing. "I don't even know what you're talking about. I don't relate to God that way. I do stuff because he says to do stuff. Delighting, enjoying, being satisfied—I don't know what you're talking about. Is he pizza? Is he football? What is the actual experience of enjoying God, finding pleasure in God, being satisfied in God?"</p>

    <h3><span class="section-number">3.</span> The Issue in the Book of Job <span class="timestamp">(8:27)</span></h3>

    <h4><span class="section-number">3.1</span> God as treasure leads to gladness:</h4>
    <p>If God is your gold, he will be your gladness. That's why Jesus said in Matthew 6:21: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also." That is, if God is your treasure, he will be your pleasure.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">3.2</span> The central issue of Job:</h4>
    <p>We're not talking here about the gifts of God, okay? We're talking about God himself. This is the great issue in the book of Job. The great issue: Did Job love God more than God's gifts? That's the issue in the book of Job.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">3.3</span> Satan's challenge:</h4>
    <p>Satan does not believe that he does love God more than God's gifts, and that's what he's gonna do. He's gonna show God he's not real. His joy is in stuff or his wife or his kids or his cattle, not you. So here's what Satan says. Satan answered the Lord and said, "Does Job fear God for no reason? Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. But put forth your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face."</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">3.4</span> Job's response to loss:</h4>
    <p>So all of his kids are dead, all of his cattle are stolen, and here's what he says: "Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped. And he said, 'Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.'" Don't you love that song? I'll bet you've sung that and don't have any idea what you're saying. "They're dead. She's dead. You are blessed. You're a good God. I love you." Be careful what you sing.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">3.5</span> Satan's second challenge:</h4>
    <p>Satan goes back to God. He's not persuaded. "No, God, yeah, kids are dead, livestock is gone." Here's what he said: "Satan answered the Lord and said, 'Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life. But put forth your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face.'" Wrong again.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">3.6</span> Examples from Scripture:</h4>
    <p>Is Job like the psalmist in Psalm 63: "Your steadfast love, O Lord, is better than life"? So you got to choose between life and all the pleasures of it and steadfast love. And the psalmist says, "I'll take God and his love, and I will die." Is Job like the prophet Habakkuk? My wife and I chose this text for our wedding text 49 years ago: "Though the fig tree should not blossom, nor fruit be on the vines, the produce of the olive fail and the fields yield no food, the flock be cut off from the fold and there be no herd in the stalls, yet I will rejoice in the Lord; I will take joy in the God of my salvation."</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">3.7</span> The ultimate test:</h4>
    <p>God is to be treasured. God is to be enjoyed more than his gifts in prosperity and poverty, in health and disease, in life and death.</p>

    <h3><span class="section-number">4.</span> Question 1: What Is It Like to Delight in God? <span class="timestamp">(17:11)</span></h3>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.1</span> Delight in a person, not a thing:</h4>
    <p>The first and most fundamental thing that needs to be said is that pleasure in God, delight in God, satisfaction in God is satisfaction in a person, not a thing or an idea or a set of actions—a person.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.2</span> Ultimate reality as person:</h4>
    <p>I wonder if you've ever pondered, maybe late at night looking up at the sky, that for all eternity, for all eternity past, there has been something always there because nothingness can't give rise to something. The meaning of nothingness—it's no thing. It can't do it. Can't create. Nothing is nothing. It's nothing. If there is something, there's always been something. That's amazing just that—that there's always been a reality. Then have you ever considered that therefore there was no time before this reality? There were no set of circumstances. There were no conditions. There were no influences that could make this reality more likely to be one thing than another thing. What it is, it is. And nothing made it what it is. Therefore, when the Bible reveals in its words and in Jesus Christ ultimate reality is a person, it's not saying anything inconceivable. It's not saying anything impossible. It's not saying anything improbable.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.3</span> Biblical commands to enjoy God:</h4>
    <p>When you get up in the morning, what you should do is just start reading your Bible. You don't have to have any of those thoughts at all to find out there's a person out there, and that person is to be enjoyed. Philippians 4: "Rejoice in the Lord." Psalm 37: "Delight yourself in the Lord." Psalm 32: "Be glad in the Lord." Psalm 16: "In your presence there is fullness of joy." Psalm 16 again: "The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup." Psalm 42: "As a deer pants for the flowing streams, so my soul pants for you, O God. My soul thirsts for God, for the living God." Psalm 143: "I stretch out my hands to you; my soul thirsts for you like a parched land." Romans 5:11: "We rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation."</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.4</span> Why Jesus died:</h4>
    <p>This is why Jesus died. You and I, everybody in these rooms, are sinners. We can't come to God and enjoy him. We get incinerated if we come to God. He is holy. He can't even look upon evil without rage. And if that's all you are, that's all you get. And so we had to be saved. We had to be redeemed. We needed someone to bear our guilt, bear our condemnation, which Jesus did, so that he reconciled us to a person. He reconciled us to a person. That's how reconciliation happens. And then 1 Peter 3:18: "Christ suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God." That's why he suffered—to bring us to a person. To bring us to God. Not to get us to heaven—to God. Get us out of hell—to God. Get us prosperous—to God. He died to bring us to a person.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.5</span> How we know the person of God:</h4>
    <p>The enjoyment of God is the enjoyment of a person, not the enjoyment of a thing or an idea or a pattern of actions. But that's the way we get to know the person—things that he made that taste like him, point to him; ideas revealed in the Bible; patterns of activity in history and in the world, which when we see them we say, "I love him because he did that." So right, those things are not God, and they're not the endpoint of our joy. But you would never be joyful in God without things, without ideas, and without actions on his part.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.6</span> Person-revealing actions:</h4>
    <p>Consider these person-revealing actions. This is 1 John 4: "In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent"—okay, there's an action—"God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him." We know the love of a person by the action of the loving person. We know the power of the person by the action of his creation (Romans 1). We know the wisdom of the person by the purposeful providence in history (Romans 11). We know the justice and righteousness of the person because of the death of Jesus bearing sin and providing righteousness. We know the fullness and faithfulness of the person because he keeps his promises. We know compassion and patience in that person because we know Jesus Christ. We've watched the compassionate Christ, and he said, "If you've seen me, you've seen the Father."</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.7</span> Things as pointers to God:</h4>
    <p>The same thing is true of things—this is so important to see—and the same thing is true of things and experiences in life. They're given by God to show us God, through whom we can taste God. We know something of the sweetness of his friendship because we've tasted honey. That's why honey exists. That's why the Bible uses it. Honey exists to help you know God. We know something of his sustaining richness because we've eaten bread when we're hungry. Good—you know, not fluffy white stuff that you make fish bait out of—really solid French bread or German bread. You know, if you've eaten that, you know God better, or you should. We know something of the warmth of his affections because we remember being held by our mother. We know something of the personal depths and exquisite intensity of person-to-person pleasure because we have felt sexual desire. That's what sex is for—to know God, taste God. And we know something of his worth because we have coveted gold. And even our sins bear witness to his worth.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.8</span> Moving through gifts to God:</h4>
    <p>So whatever action is good in this life, whatever idea is good and true, whatever thing you see or hear or taste or touch—God's creation, all of it—is designed by God as a sign and a foretaste of what it's like to enjoy God himself. So crucifixion, creation, providence, covenant, honey, bread, water, sex, mother, gold—these are not God, but they are his gifts. And if our enjoyment terminates on them, we are idolaters. We are to move into and through the gifts to him. And they taste the way he tastes.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.9</span> Thought experiment about enjoying people:</h4>
    <p>I think one of the best pointers to the taste of the experience of enjoying God is the enjoyment of human people—people you know, people in your family perhaps, or maybe that's not true, people outside your family. So here's what I want you to do—a little thought experiment, or do it later when you've got a quiet moment. Think of the kindest person you know. Think of the most loving person you know. I'm thinking human person now—just friends, family, or maybe musicians or artists or the most loving person, the wisest person you know, the most patient person you know, the most intelligent person you know, the strongest person you know, the most tender-hearted person, the happiest person, the most peaceful person, the most optimistic person, the meekest person, the most courageous person, the most articulate person, the one who has the best sense of humor, the most generous person.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.10</span> Imagining God's perfection:</h4>
    <p>So think of all those people, and then when you do that, combine them all into one person—all those traits. And then when you do that, increase those traits to perfection in quality. And then increase them to infinite beauty in how they are proportioned and exercised by that person. And then let all that enjoyment of those persons with those excellencies raised to that perfection and that beauty give you a hint of what it is like to enjoy God as a person. And then pray that the Holy Spirit would grant that miracle to happen, because none of you enjoys God without the miracle of the Holy Spirit. We are dead to those beauties in God, and they are a foreign language to us.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">4.11</span> Answer to question 1:</h4>
    <p>So my answer to question number 1 is that to enjoy God is to enjoy a person who is infinitely all-satisfying in the constellation of his traits that you enjoy in other people.</p>

    <h3><span class="section-number">5.</span> Question 2: Is That Your Highest Duty? <span class="timestamp">(31:35)</span></h3>

    <h4><span class="section-number">5.1</span> The question posed:</h4>
    <p>So sitting there right now, posing yourself the question: "When I leave this place, or even as I sit here, what is the highest obligation God puts upon me? Is it this—is it enjoying, delighting in, being satisfied in the person God and Jesus Christ his Son by the power of his Spirit? Is that my highest duty?" And my answer is yes.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">5.2</span> Light burden, not heavy load:</h4>
    <p>And as I speak them, I hope that you don't feel them as a heavy load, but rather as a light burden and an easy yoke. Jesus said, "Come to me, and I'll put a yoke on you for sure, and I'll put a burden on you, but the burden will be light and the yoke will be easy" (Matthew 11:28). So my prayer for you now, as I give you these three reasons for why it is your highest duty, your greatest obligation to be happy in God, rejoice in God, delight in God, be satisfied in God, it is not that you would be burdened by this, but freed. I mean, what is more liberating or thrilling or amazing than that God would come to you, a hopeless sinner, point you to his Son Jesus Christ as the one who bears all your guilt, and then gives you this commandment: "My first commandment to you, my highest commandment to you, is that you be supremely satisfied in what is supremely satisfying." I don't think that would feel like a burden. "Be supremely satisfied in what is supremely satisfying." That's freedom.</p>

    <h3><span class="section-number">6.</span> Three Reasons This Is Your Highest Duty <span class="timestamp">(32:58)</span></h3>

    <h4><span class="section-number">6.1</span> Reason 1: The Greatest Commandment:</h4>
    <p>Jesus said, when asked, "Which is the great commandment in the law?" he answered, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment." So the great and first commandment according to Jesus is that you love God. Now right here, the flesh, the old unregenerate you, does a horrible thing, namely it turns love into deeds. "Okay, what I got to do? I got to do some stuff here now because he said number one agenda—love me with all your heart, soul, mind, strength."</p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.1.1</span> Love is delight, not just doing:</h4>
        <p>The essence of loving is not doing. The essence of loving is delighting when God is the object. "If you lay gold in the dust, the Almighty will be your gold. Then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God." Loving God is not first working for God.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.1.2</span> Addressing John 14:15:</h4>
        <p>Somebody right now is quoting in your head: "What about John 14:15? 'If you love me, you will keep my commandments.'" Well, what about it? It's massively important to see—he's distinguishing the two. If you do the one, you'll do the other. They're not the same. "If you love me, you'll do"—but doing is not that. This is root, that's fruit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.1.3</span> Heart comes first:</h4>
        <p>Maybe that's why in the list of heart, soul, mind, strength, in every time it occurs in the Gospels, heart is first. Because the heart is not an organ of performance; it's an organ of preference. The heart prefers, and then we do. We stop and accord with our preferences. And the first commandment is: Love him with all your preference. Prefer him above everything. Let him be your gold, your silver, your everything. And it'll change all your doings. But if you try to get that reversed and do because you can't conceive what it means to delight, to prefer, to enjoy, to treasure, you won't be a Christian. That's not Christianity.</p>
    </div>

    <h4><span class="section-number">6.2</span> Reason 2: Loving Others Flows from Joy in God:</h4>
    <p>The second commandment is like it: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." Like it—like, whoa, this is equally important. And my argument is the way the Bible presents loving people is that authentic Christ-exalting love for people is the overflow of joy in God, or it's not love in a biblical sense.</p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.2.1</span> The Macedonian example:</h4>
        <p>Let me read for you two verses which I think are one of the most amazing and beautiful pictures of love between people in the Bible. This is a word from the apostle Paul to the Corinthians to think about the way the Macedonian Christians love and then to be like that. So this is a commendation of the Macedonians because of how they are loving. "We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia." Now listen really carefully—put every piece together: "For in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.2.2</span> Joy overflows in love:</h4>
        <p>Joy overflowed in generosity. That's love. Generosity is love. Give yourself and you give things to people who have needs. You're for them. You're there for them. That's what love is. And where does it come from? It comes from joy—their joy, their abundant joy overflowed in love.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.2.3</span> Gospel joy, not circumstantial joy:</h4>
        <p>Now here's the reason those two other little phrases that I read. This joy is not in prosperity because it says they are in extreme poverty. So if you say, "I gotta have some good circumstances here to get myself happy so I can love people," you won't have Christian love. You'll have circumstance-driven love. We also know it's not because of comforts because he said they're in extreme affliction—severe affliction. So you got extreme poverty, severe affliction, abundant joy, which means this joy is gospel joy in God, and it overflows in love to other people.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.2.4</span> Joy in God is necessary for love:</h4>
        <p>Therefore, joy in God is our first obligation because loving people is an equal obligation to loving God. This is huge. You think you love people? You don't love people if you are not satisfied in God, because Christ is not being exalted. God is not being exalted. The Bible won't define love without God. It won't define love without Christ.</p>
    </div>

    <h4><span class="section-number">6.3</span> Reason 3: God's Glory Is Greatest:</h4>
    <p>The glory of God is the greatest reality in the universe. It's way greater than our joy in God. The greatness of God, the beauty of God, is the greatest reality in the universe—most important. And God has made it plain that we exist to magnify that beauty. You probably could give me the verse: 1 Corinthians 10:31: "Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God." So you are on the planet eating and drinking and doing everything else—whatever you do—to make God look glorious. That's why you're here. If you don't, you're failing.</p>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.3.1</span> The central thesis:</h4>
        <p>And my argument is that God is most glorified in you when you are most satisfied in him. That's the banner that flies over my life. That's the message Louie asked me to bring for 20 years to this group: God is most glorified in you when you are most satisfied in him.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="subsection">
        <h4><span class="section-number">6.3.2</span> The Passion connection:</h4>
        <p>There's a verse that got Passion started in Louie's heart, namely Isaiah 26:8: "Your name and your renown are the desire of our souls." And Louie met with me 21 years ago, maybe 22, and he said, "I want you to connect those two—the renown of God, the fame of God, the glory of God, and the desire of the human soul." We desperately desire. Our hearts are a desire factory. And I said, "I would like to try to," because that's my life. That's what I am to do and be, all too imperfectly.</p>
    </div>

    <h3><span class="section-number">7.</span> Illustration: The Anniversary Story <span class="timestamp">(44:33)</span></h3>

    <h4><span class="section-number">7.1</span> Setting up the illustration:</h4>
    <p>Now I could—if we had time, I got four minutes, we're gonna make it—I could, if I had time, take you to Philippians 1:20-21 and give you a solid exegetical argument for that statement, namely that Christ is most magnified when Paul is most satisfied in him, so that when he lives or dies he says, "Gain." I could do that, but instead I'm gonna end with a story. I love this story, and you will enjoy it because you like love stories, and it's about me and my wife.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">7.2</span> The setup:</h4>
    <p>So two weeks ago, we celebrated our 49th wedding anniversary. Thank you—on God's behalf. Marriage is about grace and forgiveness. You will find out. So let's suppose now—remember what I'm doing here with this story. I am trying to make the point that God is most glorified in us when we're most satisfied in him. All right, so I buy—because we're in our fiftieth year of marriage now, okay, even though it's 49—and I hold these bunch of roses. They cost 200 bucks, right, give or take. I hold this huge bundle of roses behind my back, and instead of walking in my front door, I ring the doorbell—just unusual—and she comes to the door. She looks puzzled, and I say, "Happy anniversary, Noél!"</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">7.3</span> The wrong response:</h4>
    <p>And she says, "Oh, Johnny! They're beautiful! Why did you go to such an expense?" And suppose I said, "It's my duty. I read it in a book. This is what husbands do." What's wrong with that answer? You're shaking your head. That's right. You should be shaking your head.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">7.4</span> The right response:</h4>
    <p>Okay, I'll show you what's wrong with the answer. Rewind. Ding-dong. "Happy anniversary, Noél!" "Oh, Johnny! They're beautiful! Why did you go to such an expense?" "Well, I couldn't help myself. In fact, I've got a plan for this evening. I want you to go put on something nice because we're going out, because there's nothing I'd rather do than spend the evening with you. It would make me very happy." [Applause]</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">7.5</span> The principle:</h4>
    <p>Do you think—do you think that at that moment she would say, "It would make you happy? You're always thinking about what makes you happy"? But I'm—you think she'd say that? When I said, "This evening spent with you as an all-satisfied person in my life tonight would make me happy," you think she'd say, "Well, you ever think about what makes me happy"? Why? Because she is glorified when I'm satisfied in her. You know this. You know this in your experience. What you find—or she or he—in whom you find pleasure makes them your treasure. That's what they feel: "I feel treasured right now because you are finding your joy in me. I feel treasured." So does God. That's the point.</p>

    <h4><span class="section-number">7.6</span> Application to God:</h4>
    <p>So don't go to church and say, "That's what Christians do. I read it in a book." Ring the doorbell, and when God opens the door, say, "Nothing would make me happier than to meet you here, because I need you." "If you lay gold in the dust, then the Almighty will be your gold. For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God." And that delight will be in an infinitely beautiful, all-satisfying person, and it will be your highest duty.</p>

    <h3><span class="section-number">8.</span> Closing Prayer <span class="timestamp">(49:47)</span></h3>
    
    <div class="prayer">
        <p>Father in heaven, I plead with you now for myself and for these friends, these students especially. I plead with you that the miracle would happen in our hearts so that all the delight that we have in the things you've made, which are good things, would not be the termination of our delights. I pray that we would move through the most admirable people in our life and the most admirable things in our life and the most admirable actions that we see you perform—we would move through them all the way up to you and find our treasure and our pleasure. I pray this in Jesus' name. Amen.</p>
