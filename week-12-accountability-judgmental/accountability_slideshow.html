        <div class="slide story-slide">
            <h2>The Dangerous Game of Mistaken Identity</h2>
            <p>Let me tell you about Sarah's embarrassing mistake...</p>
            <p>She was going through a difficult divorce and desperately needed to talk to someone.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: The Setup -->
        <div class="slide story-slide">
            <h3>Sarah's Search for Help</h3>
            <p>Her friend had given her the number for "James Smith," a counselor who had helped her through her own marital crisis.</p>
            <p>Sarah was nervous but finally worked up the courage to call.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: The Conversation -->
        <div class="slide story-slide">
            <h3>Pouring Out Her Heart</h3>
            <p>When a man answered and said, "This is James," she poured out her heart.</p>
            <p>She shared intimate details about her marriage, her fears about the future, her financial struggles, even her deepest insecurities about whether she was lovable.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: The Awkward Revelation -->
        <div class="slide story-slide">
            <h3>The Wrong Number</h3>
            <p>There was an awkward silence...</p>
            <p>Then the man said: <em>"Ma'am, I think you have the wrong number. I'm James Smith the plumber, not James Smith the counselor."</em></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 6: The Point -->
        <div class="slide story-slide">
            <h3>A Simple Mistake</h3>
            <p>Sarah had just shared her most private struggles with a complete stranger.</p>
            <p>Why? Because there are over 31,000 James Smiths in the United States alone, and she had dialed the wrong one.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 7: The Spiritual Warning -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>The Same Mistake We Make with God</h3>
            <p>We might chuckle at Sarah's mistake, but here's what's not funny:</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">Many people today approach God the same way.</span></p>
            <p>They pray to "God" and tell Him their deepest needs, but they've never bothered to learn who He actually is.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 8: Wrong Jesus -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>The Wrong Jesus</h3>
            <p>They've created a Jesus in their minds based on:</p>
            <p>• What feels comfortable</p>
            <p>• What they've heard from others</p>
            <p>• What fits their lifestyle</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><span class="highlight">But what if they're talking to the wrong Jesus?</span></p>

        <!-- Slide 9: The Hall Twins Introduction -->
        <div class="slide story-slide">
            <h2>A Story That Should Chill Us</h2>
            <p>Larry and Gary Hall were identical twin brothers who grew up in the same house in Indiana.</p>
            <p>Same parents, same upbringing, went to the same schools.</p>
            <p>If you saw them from a distance, you couldn't tell them apart.</p>

        <!-- Slide 10: The Terrifying Truth -->
        <div class="slide story-slide">
            <h3>But Here's Where It Gets Terrifying</h3>
            <p>Larry Hall became one of America's most prolific serial killers, suspected of murdering dozens of women across multiple states.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, his identical twin brother Gary lived a normal life, held down jobs, and was never suspected of any wrongdoing.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 11: Life and Death -->
        <div class="slide story-slide">
            <h3>Mistaken Identity Could Cost Your Life</h3>
            <p>Imagine if you were alone at night and approached by one of these brothers.</p>
            <p>From appearance alone, you couldn't tell which one you were facing.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">A simple case of mistaken identity could cost you your life.</span></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 12: The Spiritual Parallel -->
        <div class="slide warning-slide">
            <h2>This Is a Spiritual Warning</h2>
            <p>Many people today think they know Jesus because they know a few basic facts:</p>
            <p>• He was a good teacher</p>
            <p>• He loved people</p>
            <p>• He died on a cross</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 13: Two Different Jesus -->
        <div class="slide warning-slide">
            <h3>As Different as Larry and Gary Hall</h3>
            <p>The Jesus of Scripture and the Jesus of popular culture are as different as Larry and Gary Hall.</p>
            <p><span class="highlight">One leads to eternal life; the other leads to eternal death.</span></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 14: The Most Terrifying Words -->
        <div class="slide warning-slide">
            <h3>The Most Terrifying Words Ever Spoken</h3>
            <p>Many people will stand before God confident they know Him, only to hear:</p>
            <div class="verse" style="margin-top: 25px;">
                "I never knew you"
                <br><br>- Matthew 7:23

        </div>

        <!-- Slide 15: The Critical Question -->

            <p style="font-size: clamp(20px, 5vw, 36px); text-align: center; margin-top: 40px;">
                Are we following the Jesus of Scripture, or a Jesus of our own imagination?
            </p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 16: Voddie Quote -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="quote">
                "I choose to believe the Bible because it is a reliable collection of historical documents written down by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses."

            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">If we're going to claim to know Jesus, we need to know Him as He actually is, not as we wish He were.</p>

        <div class="slide">

        </div>

        <!-- Slide 18: The False Teaching -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>The False Teaching That's Destroying the Church</h2>
            <p>"Jesus said not to judge, so we should never tell anyone they're doing anything wrong."</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">This idea has become so deeply embedded in our culture that even Christians feel guilty about addressing sin.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 19: Why This Teaching Is Dangerous -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>This Teaching Is Devastating Lives</h3>
            <p>When we refuse to lovingly address sin, we're not being loving—<span class="highlight">we're being negligent.</span></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">We're like doctors who refuse to tell patients they have cancer because we don't want to hurt their feelings.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 20: What Jesus Actually Said -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>What Jesus Actually Said About Judging</h2>
            <p>Let's look at the most misquoted passage in the Bible...</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 21: Matthew 7:1-5 Combined -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="verse">
                "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you.
                <br><br>
                Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? ...
                <br><br>
                You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."
                <br><br>- Matthew 7:1-5 (NIV)
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 22: What Jesus Is Really Teaching -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Notice What Jesus Is Actually Teaching</h3>
            <p>He's NOT saying, "Never address sin in others."</p>
            <p>He's giving us <span class="highlight">the proper order and heart attitude</span> for doing so.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Jesus assumes we WILL help remove the speck from our brother's eye—but only after we've dealt with our own issues first.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 23: Two Types of Judgment -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>The Critical Difference</h2>
            <p><strong>Hypocritical judgment says:</strong></p>
            <p>"I'm better than you, and I'm going to point out your sin while ignoring my own."</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;"><strong>Loving correction says:</strong></p>
            <p>"I struggle with sin too, but I care about you enough to help you see what's hurting you and others."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <h3>Love Cannot Remain Silent</h3>
            <p>When we see someone we care about walking in patterns that are destroying their life, their relationships, and their witness for Christ, love cannot remain silent.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px; text-align: center; font-style: italic; font-size: clamp(22px, 5vw, 36px);">Love warns.</p>

            <p>How can we tell the difference between loving correction and judgmental criticism?</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">Can you think of a time when someone's loving correction helped you grow?</p>

        <div class="slide">
            <h2>A Church That Refused to Address Sin</h2>
            <p>The church in Corinth thought they were being loving and progressive.</p>
            <p>They had a situation that would make headlines today: a man was living in a sexual relationship with his stepmother.</p>

        <!-- Slide 29: Even Pagans Were Shocked -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>A Shocking Situation</h3>
            <p>Even the pagan culture around them was shocked by this behavior.</p>

                "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father's wife. And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this?"
                <br><br>- 1 Corinthians 5:1-2 (NIV)
            </div>

        <div class="slide">
            <div class="verse">
                "No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are."
                <br><br>- 1 John 3:9-10 (NIV)

        <!-- Slide 79: Warning Signs - Part 1 -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Warning Signs We Should Take Seriously</h2>
            <p>• Lack of conviction about sin—they're comfortable with behaviors God clearly calls wrong</p>
            <p>• No hunger for God's Word—the Bible feels boring or irrelevant to them</p>
            <p>• No desire for fellowship with believers—they prefer the company of unbelievers and avoid church</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 80: Warning Signs - Part 2 -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h3>More Warning Signs</h3>
            <p>• No fruit of the Spirit over time—their character doesn't reflect love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control</p>
            <p>• Easy acceptance of sin in their life—they have explanations for why God's commands don't apply to them</p>
            <p>• Defensive attitude when confronted with biblical truth—they get angry rather than humble when corrected</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 81: The Compass Illustration -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>The Broken Compass</h2>
            <p>A broken compass is dangerous not because it doesn't point somewhere, but because <span class="highlight">it points confidently in the wrong direction.</span></p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">False assurance is more dangerous than honest doubt because it keeps people from seeking the truth.</p>

        <!-- Slide 84: What We've Covered -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>The Journey We've Taken</h2>
            <p>We've covered a lot of ground today, but it all comes down to this:</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px; font-size: clamp(20px, 5vw, 34px);"><span class="highlight">Knowing the real Jesus and living in genuine relationship with Him is a matter of eternal life and death.</span></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 85: Four Essential Truths -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Four Essential Truths We Cannot Compromise</h2>
            <p>1. True Christians cannot overlook sin—love requires addressing it biblically</p>
            <p>2. Church discipline is loving—it aims to restore people and protect the community</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 86: Four Essential Truths Continued -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Four Essential Truths (continued)</h2>
            <p>3. True faith endures—those who completely fall away likely never truly belonged to Christ</p>
            <p>4. Real Christianity produces fruit—genuine conversion shows itself through changed life and perseverance</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 87: The Goal -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Always Remember the Goal</h2>
            <p style="text-align: center; font-size: clamp(20px, 5vw, 34px);">The goal is never condemnation but restoration, protection, and the glory of God through holy living.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 88: Remember the Hall Twins -->
        <div class="slide">
            <h2>Remember the Hall Twins</h2>
            <p>Two men who looked identical on the outside but were completely different on the inside.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px;">Many people today think they know Jesus because they know some facts about Him, but they've never truly met Him as Lord and Savior.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><span class="highlight">They're following a Jesus of their imagination rather than the Jesus of Scripture.</span></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 89: Final Scripture -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="verse">
                "Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction."
                <br><br>- 2 Timothy 4:2 (NIV)
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 30px; text-align: center;">Biblical accountability combines correction with encouragement, always motivated by love for God and others.</p>
