    <h1>Biblical Accountability vs. Being Judgmental: Knowing the Real Jesus</h1>
    <div class="subtitle">An 80-Minute Teaching Session</div>

    <hr class="section-divider">

    <h2>Opening: The Dangerous Game of Mistaken Identity</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">(8 minutes)</div>

    <p>Let me tell you about Sarah's embarrassing mistake. She was going through a difficult divorce and desperately needed to talk to someone. Her friend had given her the number for "James Smith," a counselor who had helped her through her own marital crisis. Sarah was nervous but finally worked up the courage to call. When a man answered and said, "This is James," she poured out her heart. She shared intimate details about her marriage, her fears about the future, her financial struggles, even her deepest insecurities about whether she was lovable.</p>

    <p>There was an awkward silence. Then the man said, "Ma'am, I think you have the wrong number. I'm James Smith the plumber, not James Smith the counselor."</p>

    <p>Sarah had just shared her most private struggles with a complete stranger. Why? Because there are over 31,000 James Smiths in the United States alone, and she had dialed the wrong one.</p>

    <p>We might chuckle at Sarah's mistake, but here's what's not funny: Many people today approach God the same way. They pray to "God" and tell Him their deepest needs, but they've never bothered to learn who He actually is. They've created a Jesus in their minds based on what feels comfortable, what they've heard from others, or what fits their lifestyle. But what if they're talking to the wrong Jesus?</p>

    <p>Now let me tell you a story that should chill us to the bone. Larry and Gary Hall were identical twin brothers who grew up in the same house in Indiana. They had the same parents, the same upbringing, went to the same schools. If you saw them from a distance, you couldn't tell them apart. But here's where the story gets terrifying: Larry Hall became one of America's most prolific serial killers, suspected of murdering dozens of women across multiple states. Meanwhile, his identical twin brother Gary lived a normal life, held down jobs, and was never suspected of any wrongdoing.</p>

    <p>Imagine if you were alone at night and approached by one of these brothers. From appearance alone, you couldn't tell which one you were facing. A simple case of mistaken identity could cost you your life. Knowing just a few surface details—same face, same family, same background—could lead to a fatal error.</p>

    <p>Friends, this isn't just a crime story. This is a spiritual warning. Many people today think they know Jesus because they know a few basic facts: He was a good teacher, He loved people, He died on a cross. But the Jesus of Scripture and the Jesus of popular culture are as different as Larry and Gary Hall. One leads to eternal life; the other leads to eternal death. And tragically, many people will stand before God confident they know Him, only to hear the most terrifying words ever spoken: "I never knew you" (Matthew 7:23).</p>

    <div class="key-point">
        <strong>The question we must face: Are we following the Jesus of Scripture, or a Jesus of our own imagination?</strong>
    </div>

    <p>As Voddie Baucham reminds us, "I choose to believe the Bible because it is a reliable collection of historical documents written down by eyewitnesses during the lifetime of other eyewitnesses." If we're going to claim to know Jesus, we need to know Him as He actually is, not as we wish He were.</p>

    <h2>Part 1: The Cultural Confusion About "Don't Judge"</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">(15 minutes)</div>

    <h3>The False Teaching That's Destroying the Church</h3>

    <p>I can't tell you how many times I've heard this: "Jesus said not to judge, so we should never tell anyone they're doing anything wrong." This idea has become so deeply embedded in our culture that even Christians feel guilty about addressing sin. We've been told that the most loving thing we can do is to accept everyone exactly as they are and never suggest they need to change.</p>

    <p>But friends, this teaching is not just wrong—it's devastating lives and destroying churches. When we refuse to lovingly address sin, we're not being loving; we're being negligent. We're like doctors who refuse to tell patients they have cancer because we don't want to hurt their feelings.</p>

    <h3>What Jesus Actually Said About Judging</h3>

    <p>Let's look at what Jesus really taught in the most misquoted passage in the Bible:</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Matthew 7:1-5 (NIV):</strong> "Do not judge, or you too will be judged. For in the same way you judge others, you will be judged, and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother's eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye? How can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when all the time there is a plank in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother's eye."
    </div>

    <p>Notice what Jesus is actually teaching here. He's not saying, "Never address sin in others." He's giving us the proper order and heart attitude for doing so. Jesus assumes we will help remove the speck from our brother's eye—but only after we've dealt with our own issues first.</p>

    <p>Jesus is forbidding hypocritical judgment, not loving correction. The difference is crucial:</p>

    <p><strong>Hypocritical judgment</strong> says: "I'm better than you, and I'm going to point out your sin while ignoring my own."</p>

    <p><strong>Loving correction</strong> says: "I struggle with sin too, but I care about you enough to help you see what's hurting you and others."</p>

    <h3>The Heart Behind True Love</h3>

    <p>Think about this: If your friend was about to walk off a cliff because they couldn't see the danger, would love keep you silent? Of course not! Love would compel you to warn them, even if they got angry at you for it.</p>

    <p>The same is true spiritually. When we see someone we care about walking in patterns that are destroying their life, their relationships, and their witness for Christ, love cannot remain silent. As the old saying goes, "Love warns."</p>

    <h2>Part 2: The Corinthian Church - When "Love" Becomes Harmful</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">(18 minutes)</div>

    <h3>The Problem: A Church That Refused to Address Sin</h3>

    <p>The church in Corinth thought they were being loving and progressive. They had a situation that would make headlines today: a man was living in a sexual relationship with his stepmother. Even the pagan culture around them was shocked by this behavior, but the church? They were proud of how "accepting" and "non-judgmental" they were.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>1 Corinthians 5:1-2 (NIV):</strong> "It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that even pagans do not tolerate: A man is sleeping with his father's wife. And you are proud! Shouldn't you rather have gone into mourning and have put out of your fellowship the man who has been doing this?"
    </div>

    <p>Can you hear Paul's shock? "Even the pagans wouldn't tolerate this, but you're proud of your tolerance!" The Corinthians thought their acceptance showed how much they loved this man. Paul shows them they were actually destroying him.</p>

    <h3>Why Tolerance Can Be Cruel</h3>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>1 Corinthians 5:6-7 (NIV):</strong> "Your boasting is not good. Don't you know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough? Get rid of the old yeast, so that you may be a new unleavened batch—as you really are."
    </div>

    <p>Paul uses a simple but powerful illustration. When you're making bread, it only takes a little yeast to affect the entire batch of dough. In the same way, when a church tolerates serious, unrepentant sin, it affects the entire community.</p>

    <p>Why? Because sin is contagious. When we see others getting away with behavior that God clearly calls wrong, it makes it easier for us to justify our own compromises. Before long, the whole church develops a casual attitude toward things that break God's heart.</p>

    <p>But there's something even more serious happening here. When we enable someone to continue in sin without consequences, we're not helping them—we're hurting them. We're making it easier for them to ignore God's voice and walk further away from Him.</p>

    <p>Think of it this way: If your teenager was experimenting with drugs, would love ignore it? Or would love intervene, even if it meant conflict and consequences? The Corinthians were treating spiritual danger the same way neglectful parents treat physical danger—by pretending it wasn't really that serious.</p>

    <h3>The Necessity of Church Discipline</h3>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>1 Corinthians 5:11-13 (NIV):</strong> "But now I am writing to you that you must not associate with anyone who claims to be a brother or sister but is sexually immoral or greedy, an idolater or slanderer, a drunkard or swindler. Do not even eat with such people... 'Expel the wicked person from among you.'"
    </div>

    <p>This sounds harsh to our modern ears, doesn't it? But notice something important: Paul is not talking about people who struggle with sin and are fighting against it. He's talking about people who claim to be Christians but are living in open, unrepentant sin and refusing to listen to loving correction.</p>

    <p>The goal of church discipline is never punishment for punishment's sake. It's a wake-up call. Sometimes people need to experience the consequences of their choices before they'll take them seriously.</p>

    <p>As John Piper reminds us, "Biblical church discipline is simple obedience to God and a simple confession that we need help. We cannot live the Christian life alone. Our purpose in church discipline is positive for the individual disciplined, for other Christians as they see the real danger of sin, for the health of the church as a whole, and for the corporate witness of the church to those outside."</p>

    <h3>The Beautiful Ending: When Love Works</h3>

    <p>But here's the beautiful part of the story. In Paul's second letter to the Corinthians, we see what happened:</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>2 Corinthians 2:6-8 (NIV):</strong> "The punishment inflicted on him by the majority is sufficient. Now instead, you ought to forgive and comfort him, so that he will not be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. I urge you, therefore, to reaffirm your love for him."
    </div>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>2 Corinthians 7:8-10 (NIV):</strong> "Even if I caused you sorrow by my letter, I do not regret it... because your sorrow led you to repentance. For you became sorrowful as God intended and so were not harmed in any way by us. Godly sorrow brings repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regret, but worldly sorrow brings death."
    </div>

    <p>The church discipline worked! The man repented, and now Paul urges them to welcome him back with love. This is what biblical accountability looks like when it's done right: it leads to restoration, not permanent rejection.</p>

    <h3>Two More Biblical Examples</h3>

    <p><strong>David and Nathan (2 Samuel 12:1-14):</strong> When King David committed adultery and murder, God sent the prophet Nathan to confront him. Nathan didn't post about it on social media or gossip about it to others. He went directly to David with a story that helped David see his sin clearly. David's response? "I have sinned against the Lord" (v.13). True believers respond to loving correction with repentance, not defensiveness.</p>

    <p><strong>Paul Confronting Peter (Galatians 2:11-14):</strong> Even apostles need accountability. When Peter started discriminating against Gentile Christians, Paul confronted him publicly because his sin was public and affecting others. This shows us that accountability works both ways—we all need it, regardless of our position or maturity.</p>

    <h2>Part 3: Self-Righteous Judge vs. Loving Shepherd - The Heart Makes All the Difference</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">(12 minutes)</div>

    <p>Now, just because biblical accountability is necessary doesn't mean all confrontation is biblical. There's a world of difference between being a self-righteous judge and being a loving shepherd. The difference isn't usually in what is said, but in why it's said and how it's said.</p>

    <h3>The Self-Righteous Judge:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> To feel superior, to vent frustration, or to control others</li>
        <li><strong>Attitude:</strong> Harsh, unforgiving, proud, eager to expose others</li>
        <li><strong>Method:</strong> Public shaming, gossip, permanent rejection</li>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> The sin itself and personal offense taken</li>
        <li><strong>Heart:</strong> "I'm better than you, and I'm going to prove it"</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Loving Shepherd:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Motive:</strong> To restore and protect (Galatians 6:1), to honor God</li>
        <li><strong>Attitude:</strong> Gentle, humble, sorrowful over sin rather than excited about it</li>
        <li><strong>Method:</strong> Private conversation first, biblical process, always aiming for restoration</li>
        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> The person's spiritual health and God's glory</li>
        <li><strong>Heart:</strong> "I love you too much to watch you destroy yourself"</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Galatians 6:1 (NIV):</strong> "Brothers and sisters, if someone is caught in a sin, you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently. But watch yourselves, or you also may be tempted."
    </div>

    <p>Notice that beautiful word "restore." The Greek word is katartizo, which means to mend or repair, like a fisherman mending his nets. The goal is always to fix what's broken, not to throw it away.</p>

    <h3>The Proper Process Jesus Gave Us</h3>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Matthew 18:15-17 (NIV):</strong> "If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you. If they listen to you, you have won them over. But if they will not listen, take one or two others along, so that 'every matter may be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.' If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."
    </div>

    <p>Jesus gives us a clear process that protects both the person and the community. Notice it starts private and only becomes more public if the person refuses to listen. The goal at every step is restoration.</p>

    <h3>Why We Need Each Other</h3>

    <p>Voddie Baucham hits the nail on the head: "It is one thing for me to claim that God has changed me; it is quite another for those around me to acknowledge that I have truly changed. You and I are sinners. Moreover, we are self-deceived. We do not see ourselves accurately. Every one of us thinks more of himself than he ought. We are in desperate need of brothers and sisters who will tell us the truth."</p>

    <p>This is so important. We all have blind spots. We all have areas where we justify our behavior or minimize our sin. We need people who love us enough to tell us the truth, even when it's uncomfortable.</p>

    <h2>Part 4: True vs. False Conversion - The Heart of the Matter</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">(20 minutes)</div>

    <p>Now we come to the most sobering part of our study. Everything we've talked about so far assumes we're dealing with true believers who need correction and restoration. But what if we're not? What if we're dealing with people who think they're Christians but have never actually been born again?</p>

    <p>This isn't a side issue—Jesus Himself warned us about this:</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Matthew 7:21-23 (NIV):</strong> "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'"
    </div>

    <div class="warning">
        Did you catch that word "many"? Jesus isn't talking about a few people who got confused. He's talking about many people who will be shocked to discover they were never truly converted.
    </div>

    <h3>The Parable of the Seeds: Not All "Belief" is Saving Faith</h3>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Luke 8:11-15 (NIV):</strong> Jesus explains His parable: "This is the meaning of the parable: The seed is the word of God. Those along the path are the ones who hear, and then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved. Those on the rocky ground are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away. The seed that fell among thorns stands for those who hear, but as they go on their way they are choked by life's worries, riches and pleasures, and they do not mature. But the seed on good soil stands for those with a noble and good heart, who hear the word, retain it, and by persevering produce a crop."

    <div class="key-point">
        <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Look at verse 13—"They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away." This person had what looked like faith, even joy, but it wasn't real saving faith because it didn't last.
    </div>

    <p>As R.C. Sproul warns us: "Jesus said that the number of such self-proclaiming believers, who are not really regenerate, is declared to be 'many.' This should elicit caution in our assumptions... We tend to be quite sanguine with our 'evangelism statistics' when we assume the conversion of all who answer an altar call, make a 'decision for Christ,' or recite the 'sinner's prayer.'"</p>

    <h3>What Jesus Says About True Believers</h3>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>John 10:27-29 (NIV):</strong> "My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me. I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand. My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand."
    </div>

    <p>True believers are secure in Christ's hand, but notice: they listen to His voice and follow Him. It's not just a one-time decision; it's an ongoing relationship of listening and following.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>John 15:5-6 (NIV):</strong> "I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. If you do not remain in me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned."
    </div>

    <h3>The Marks of True vs. False Conversion</h3>

    <p>Jonathan Edwards, one of the greatest theologians America has ever produced, spent years studying this issue during the Great Awakening. During that time, many people had powerful emotional experiences and claimed to be converted, but some of them later fell away completely. Edwards wanted to help people understand the difference between real conversion and fake conversion.</p>

    <p>In his classic work "Religious Affections," he explains that true conversion affects our emotions and desires in specific ways. Think of "affections" as our deepest feelings, longings, and motivations—the things that really drive us. Edwards helps us understand the difference:</p>

    <h4>True Gracious Affections (Real Conversion):</h4>

    <p>Let me put this in everyday language:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>They create increasing spiritual hunger:</strong> "The higher gracious affections are raised, the more is a spiritual appetite and longing of soul after spiritual attainments increased." In other words, the more you grow as a Christian, the more you want to grow. It's like exercise—the more fit you get, the more you enjoy working out and want to get stronger.</li>

        <li><strong>They soften your heart toward sin:</strong> When you're truly converted, sin starts to bother you more, not less. You become more sensitive to things that displease God, like a person whose eyes adjust to light and can see dirt they couldn't see before.</li>

        <li><strong>They create the gentle, loving spirit of Jesus Christ:</strong> Real Christians become more kind, patient, and forgiving over time. They're not perfect, but there's a softness and humility about them that reflects Jesus.</li>

        <li><strong>They're never satisfied with spiritual mediocrity:</strong> True believers always feel like they don't love God enough, don't know enough about Him, don't serve Him well enough. They're hungry for more of God.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>False Affections (Fake Conversion):</h4>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>They're satisfied with themselves:</strong> "An hypocrite's last end is to satisfy himself: hence he has enough. A saint's is to satisfy Christ: hence he never has enough." False converts think, "I prayed a prayer, I'm good to go." They're not hungry for more of God because they think they already have what they need.</li>

        <li><strong>They harden the heart over time:</strong> "A false conversion puts an end to convictions of conscience... he that has had a counterfeit repentance, and false comforts and joys, is like iron that has been suddenly heated and quenched; it becomes much harder than before." Instead of becoming more sensitive to sin, they become less sensitive. They find it easier to justify wrong behavior.</li>

        <li><strong>They focus on personal benefit rather than God's glory:</strong> They're interested in what God can do for them (health, wealth, happiness) more than in knowing and pleasing God for His own sake.</li>

        <li><strong>They produce temporary enthusiasm but no lasting change:</strong> Like a diet that lasts two weeks, there's initial excitement but no long-term transformation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Endurance: The Badge of True Faith</h3>

    <p>Here's one of the most important tests of real conversion: does it last? Real faith doesn't just start strong—it endures through difficulties, doubts, and seasons of struggle.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Hebrews 10:36 (NIV):</strong> "You need to persevere so that when you have done the will of God, you will receive what he has promised."
    </div>

    <p>Think about it like a marathon. Anyone can run the first mile with enthusiasm. But only trained runners finish the race. In the same way, many people start the Christian life with excitement, but only those with genuine faith keep going when things get difficult.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>1 John 2:19 (NIV):</strong> "They went out from us, but they did not really belong to us. For if they had belonged to us, they would have remained with us; but their going showed that none of them belonged to us."
    </div>

    <p>This is a sobering verse. John is talking about people who seemed to be believers, who were part of the church community, but who eventually walked away completely. John says their departure proved they were never truly converted in the first place.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Hebrews 3:14 (NIV):</strong> "We have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original conviction firmly to the very end."
    </div>

    <p>Notice the word "if." Our participation in Christ is proved by our perseverance. It's not that we earn salvation by holding on—rather, our holding on proves that we were truly saved.</p>

    <p>Charles Spurgeon put it perfectly: "Perseverance is the badge of true saints. The Christian life is not a beginning only in the ways of God, but also a continuance in the same as long as life lasts... Final perseverance is the necessary evidence of genuine conversion."</p>

    <p>Now, this doesn't mean true Christians never struggle, doubt, or even sin. We all have seasons of weakness, times when our faith feels dry, periods when we make poor choices. The difference is that genuine believers don't completely abandon faith and permanently return to their old way of life. They may wander, but they don't completely walk away. They may stumble, but they get back up. They may doubt, but they don't stop believing entirely.</p>

    <p>Think of it like a marriage. There are seasons when couples feel distant, times when they struggle, moments when they wonder if they made a mistake. But couples who are truly committed work through those difficulties. They don't give up at the first sign of trouble. In the same way, true believers stick with Jesus through the ups and downs of life.</p>

    <h2>Part 5: The Fruit Test - How Real Faith Shows Itself</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">(12 minutes)</div>

    <h3>True Christianity Bears Fruit</h3>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Matthew 7:16-20 (NIV):</strong> "By their fruit you will recognize them. Do people pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? Likewise, every good tree bears good fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, and a bad tree cannot bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus, by their fruit you will recognize them."
    </div>

    <p>Jesus uses a simple but powerful principle: you can tell what kind of tree you're looking at by the fruit it produces. In the same way, you can tell what kind of faith someone has by the fruit it produces in their life.</p>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>James 2:17 (NIV):</strong> "In the same way, faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead."
    </div>

    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>1 John 3:9-10 (NIV):</strong> "No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in them; they cannot go on sinning, because they have been born of God. This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are: Anyone who does not do what is right is not God's child, nor is anyone who does not love their brother and sister."
    </div>

    <h3>Warning Signs We Should Take Seriously</h3>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Lack of conviction about sin:</strong> They're comfortable with behaviors God clearly calls wrong</li>
        <li><strong>No hunger for God's Word:</strong> The Bible feels boring or irrelevant to them</li>
        <li><strong>No desire for fellowship with believers:</strong> They prefer the company of unbelievers and avoid church</li>
        <li><strong>No fruit of the Spirit over time:</strong> Their character doesn't reflect love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, and self-control</li>
        <li><strong>Easy acceptance of sin in their life:</strong> They have explanations for why God's commands don't apply to them</li>
        <li><strong>Defensive attitude when confronted with biblical truth:</strong> They get angry rather than humble when corrected</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Compass Illustration</h3>

    <p>A broken compass is dangerous not because it doesn't point somewhere, but because it points confidently in the wrong direction. False assurance is more dangerous than honest doubt because it keeps people from seeking the truth.</p>

    <h2>Conclusion: The Life-and-Death Importance of Getting This Right</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">(5 minutes)</div>

    <p>Friends, we've covered a lot of ground today, but it all comes down to this: knowing the real Jesus and living in genuine relationship with Him is a matter of eternal life and death.</p>

    <h3>Four Essential Truths We Cannot Compromise:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>True Christians cannot overlook sin</strong>—love requires addressing it biblically</li>
        <li><strong>Church discipline is loving</strong>—it aims to restore people and protect the community</li>
        <li><strong>True faith endures</strong>—those who completely fall away likely never truly belonged to Christ</li>
        <li><strong>Real Christianity produces fruit</strong>—genuine conversion shows itself through changed life and perseverance</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The goal is never condemnation but restoration, protection, and the glory of God through holy living.</p>

    <p>Remember the Hall twins. Two men who looked identical on the outside but were completely different on the inside. Many people today think they know Jesus because they know some facts about Him, but they've never truly met Him as Lord and Savior. They're following a Jesus of their imagination rather than the Jesus of Scripture.</p>

    <p>We speak truth in love. We confront sin with the goal of restoration. We examine the fruit in our own lives and in the lives of those we love. This is what it means to love like Jesus—the real Jesus revealed in His Word.</p>

    <div class="final-encouragement">
        <h3>Final Encouragement</h3>

        <div class="scripture">
            <strong>2 Timothy 4:2 (NIV):</strong> "Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction."
        </div>

        <p>Biblical accountability combines correction with encouragement, always motivated by love for God and others. When we truly know the Jesus of Scripture—not a Jesus of our imagination—we understand that His commands flow from His love. And when we love as He loves, we cannot remain silent when someone we care about is walking toward spiritual danger.</p>
