            <h2>Tonight's Session</h2>
            <p>I've chosen a shorter video for tonight since we have other things to cover. It's called "Are You Really a Christian?" Some of the sermons we'll watch will challenge us, and this is one of them. I thought it would be good to start by building a strong foundation on God's truth.</p>
