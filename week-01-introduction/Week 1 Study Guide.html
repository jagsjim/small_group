    <p>Here's a small-group discussion guide based on the Paul Washer sermon transcript provided.</p>

    <div class="summary-section">
        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>This sermon challenges listeners to examine their lives and ensure their faith is genuine, marked by a transformed life and a growing desire for holiness.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Christianity is more than just a cultural thing or something you do on Sunday; it's a complete transformation of your life.</li>
            <li>True believers are not saved by works, but their faith will produce a desire to be holy and to turn away from the world.</li>
            <li>God saves people to demonstrate His power, not because they deserve it, but because He is a Savior.</li>
            <li>Lowering the standards of the Gospel leads to ungodly people in the church and blasphemes God's name.</li>
            <li>A truly saved person is a new creation with new affections and desires to serve Christ and be holy.</li>
            <li>God works in believers to pull them out of the world and draw them closer to Himself.</li>
            <li>If you love the world and its ways, it might be evidence that God has not done a transforming work in you.</li>
            <li>The evidence of true conversion is not a one-time prayer but a continuous repentance and transformation.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="questions-section">
        <h2>Overview Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What does it mean to you that God's grace doesn't give us permission to do whatever we want?</li>
            <li>Do you feel that you may abuse His grace counting on forgiveness?</li>
            <li>Does knowing that God's power is in you change the way you view your own struggles and growth as a Christian?</li>
            <li>Are there areas in your life where you might be trying to "have God and the world too," and what practical steps can you take this week to separate yourself from those worldly influences?</li>
            <li>How do you feel knowing that God's reputation depends on the transformation He brings about in your life?</li>
            <li>What's one way our group can help each other stay focused on God and pursue holiness?</li>

                    <li>By nature, we love sin, but when converted, God changes us into a new creation with new desires.</li>
                    <li>We can no longer stomach the sin of this world and are ashamed we ever participated in it.</li>
                    <li>We begin to walk as saints, not as sinners.</li>
                    <li>Has God changed your heart, and does He continue changing it? Do you long to be free from the filth of this world and to be like Christ?</li>
                    <li>If you can say yes, that is a great evidence that you have been born again.</li>
