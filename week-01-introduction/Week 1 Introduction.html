    <h1>Welcome to Our Bible Study!</h1>
    <p>I'd like to open in prayer first...</p>

    <p>Before we begin the video, I wanted to share my vision for this study group and let you know what I believe at my core.</p>

    <p>My hope is simple – that each time we meet, we all walk away knowing God a little better. I want His light to shine on those corners of our lives where we might not be giving Him our best. As Romans 12:1 (NIV) reminds us: "Therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters, in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God—this is your true and proper worship." This isn't about giving God just a piece of ourselves—it's about offering our whole lives to Him.</p>

    <p>These meetings are meant to be a source of encouragement and inspiration, not just a place where we confront areas of disobedience. While God's truth may challenge us, His ultimate goal is always to build us up and draw us closer to Him. We come together to lift each other up in our faith journey and to spur one another on toward love and good deeds, as Hebrews 10:24-25 encourages us.</p>

    <p>I know we're all juggling busy schedules, so instead of assigning reading between meetings, we'll watch a sermon together, discuss it, and explore some prepared questions. Most sermons are under an hour, and I'll do my best to wrap things up by 9. We'll start and end each session with prayer, and it would be great if different people could lead these prayers. This helps us all get more comfortable praying out loud. No pressure if you're not ready yet, but I encourage everyone to give it a try when you feel comfortable.</p>

    <p>I'll preview each sermon beforehand to make sure the content is biblically sound. I'm not a trained theologian though, so I ask for your grace and prayers as I facilitate. Please ask questions when something isn't clear, and don't hesitate to speak up if you disagree with something. Just remember that our disagreements should be grounded in Scripture rather than our feelings or opinions. As Jeremiah 17:9 (ESV) warns us: "The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately sick; who can understand it?"</p>

    <h2>My Core Beliefs:</h2>

    <h3>The Bible is God's Inerrant Word</h3>
    <p>Scripture is completely trustworthy and incapable of being wrong. "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness." (2 Timothy 3:16, NIV)</p>

    <h3>Salvation Comes Through Faith Alone</h3>
    <p class="indent">We are saved by God's grace through faith – it's His gift and doesn't depend on our works. "For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—not by works, so that no one can boast." (Ephesians 2:8-9, NIV)</p>

    <h3>True Salvation Requires Repentance</h3>
    <p class="indent">Jesus' first message was clear: "The time has come. The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!" (Mark 1:15, NIV). Repentance isn't just saying "sorry" – it's actively turning FROM your sin and turning TOWARDS Christ. You can't do one without the other. Both faith and repentance are necessary: "Peter replied, 'Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins.'" (Acts 2:38, NIV)</p>

    <h3>Understanding the Difference Between Knowing & Believing</h3>
    <p>Many Christians inadvertently confuse merely knowing facts about God with truly believing in Him. James 2:19 (NIV) reminds us: "You believe that there is one God. Good! Even the demons believe that—and shudder." True belief goes beyond intellectual agreement to wholehearted trust and obedience. Head knowledge without heart transformation and obedient action misses the full richness of faith. As Jesus said, "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven." (Matthew 7:21, NIV)</p>

    <h3>Genuine Faith Produces Good Works</h3>
    <p class="indent">"Faith by itself, if it is not accompanied by action, is dead." (James 2:17, NIV). We were created for this purpose: "For we are God's handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do." (Ephesians 2:10, NIV)</p>

    <h3>We Must Test Our Faith</h3>
    <p>"Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith; test yourselves." (2 Corinthians 13:5, NIV). The entire book of 1 John gives us ways to test if our faith is genuine. We need to be aware of false conversions – the devil loves to twist scriptures like Romans 10:9, making people think that merely confessing with your mouth is enough. Simply saying the sinner's prayer once isn't biblical salvation if it doesn't lead to a transformed life where Christ is Lord.</p>

    <h3>True Believers Cannot Lose Salvation</h3>
    <p class="indent">"Who will bring any charge against those whom God has chosen?... Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?... Neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord." (Romans 8:33, 35, 39, NIV). However, some who think they're saved may not be: "Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'" (Matthew 7:23, NIV)</p>

    <h3>Understanding Grace and Mercy</h3>
    <p>Grace means receiving what we don't deserve (salvation), while mercy means not getting what we do deserve (punishment).</p>

    <h3>We Are Called to Love One Another</h3>
    <p>"A new command I give you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another. By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you love one another." (John 13:34-35, NIV)</p>

    <h3>True Love Speaks Truth</h3>
    <p>"Instead, speaking the truth in love, we will grow to become in every respect the mature body of him who is the head, that is, Christ." (Ephesians 4:15, NIV). In a world that often misunderstands grace and mercy, real love means caring enough to speak truth. Think of it this way: if I saw you about to drink a glass of poison mistaking it for water, true love would compel me to stop you. I have to care more about preventing harm to you than about agreeing with you or turning a blind eye. The same applies to spiritual matters – sometimes the most loving thing we can do is speak difficult truth.</p>

    <h2>Tonight's Session</h2>
    <p>I've chosen a shorter video for tonight since we have other things to cover. It's called "Are You Really a Christian?" Some of the sermons we'll watch will challenge us, and this is one of them. I thought it would be good to start by building a strong foundation on God's truth.</p>
