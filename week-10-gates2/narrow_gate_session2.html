        <h2>Recap from Session 1</h2>
        
        <p>In Session 1, we learned that Jesus presents us with four contrasts: two gates, two paths, two crowds, and two destinations. We focused on the first two elements:</p>
        
        <p><strong>Two Entrances:</strong> The Christian life must be entered intentionally through repentance and faith—not accidentally through family heritage, church attendance, or repeating a prayer. Saying "I've been a Christian all my life" is theologically impossible because we're born in sin.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Two Paths:</strong> The Christian life must be lived purposefully on a hard road marked by persecution. Modern "easy gospel" presentations that promise comfort are false—Jesus said the way would be difficult and involve suffering.</p>
        
        <div class="key-takeaway">
            <strong>Key takeaway:</strong> We must test ourselves to see if we're in the faith because there's not just an entrance to Christianity, but also a way of life that follows.
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    
    <div class="highlight">
        <strong>Highlight sentence:</strong> The Christian life must be endured patiently with few companions on a hard road marked by persecution, while testing ourselves to see if we're truly in the faith, because endurance and fruit are evidence of real salvation.

    <div class="main-points">
        <h3>Main Points:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The one who endures to the end will be saved—not the one who prays a sinner's prayer, but the one who perseveres through trials and persecution.</li>
            
            <li>Most people are on the broad road because of sin nature and active rebellion—no one seeks God or does truly good apart from being redeemed by Christ.</li>
            
            <li>Many people on the broad road use biblical language and attend church regularly, but they've been deceived into thinking they're saved when they're not.</li>
            
            <li>False gospel presentations seal people in their unbelief by telling them they're saved based on words they said rather than encouraging ongoing testing and fruit.</li>
            
            <li>Endurance is evidence of salvation, not evidence of earning it—it shows that Christ is holding on to us, not that we're holding on to Him.</li>
            
            <li>There is only life at the end of the narrow gate and hard road—nowhere else, not even parts of the broad road that resemble the narrow path.</li>

        <h3>Segment Questions</h3>
        
        <p><span class="timestamp">[50:16]</span> The pastor said even a firefighter saving a child isn't doing "good" without faith. Why do you think we usually believe only really bad people (like Hitler) go to hell, while most "decent" people go to heaven?</p>
        
        <p><span class="timestamp">[54:54]</span> Before hearing Voddie, did you ever think some Christians were 'over-committed'? Consider this: the early church was largely made up of committed followers, while many modern churches include seekers and casual attendees. What if they're on the road to life, while you are on the road to destruction?</p>
        
        <p><span class="timestamp">[59:23]</span> If you pointed to a date in your Bible when you "prayed a prayer," but your life shows no fruit or change, how do you know your salvation is real and not the false assurance the pastor just described?</p>

        <h3>Overview Questions</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Have you ever questioned whether you're truly saved? Or does pride prevent you from honestly testing whether you are in the faith?</li>
            
            <li>How would you lovingly approach someone who seems to have false assurance because they "prayed a prayer" years ago but shows no fruit?</li>
            
            <li>If someone who cared about you suggested you examine yourself to see if you're truly in the faith, how would you respond? Would you be defensive or grateful?</li>
            
            <li>When we hear of a "Christian" who walks away from the faith, how do we reconcile this with Jesus' promise in John 10:28: "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one will snatch them out of my hand"? What does this tell us about their original profession of faith?</li>

        <h2>Transcript (Outline Format)</h2>
        
        <h3>Endurance as Evidence (37:45)</h3>
        <p><strong>21.1</strong> Here's the other thing: "The one who endures to the end will be saved"—not the one who prays the sinner's prayer. The one who endures to the end.</p>
        
        <p><strong>21.2</strong> How many times do you run into people who are absolutely not enduring? "Are you a Christian?" "Of course I'm a Christian! Why? Because I prayed that prayer at the front of the aisle one day and they told me on that day that I entered into the kingdom of God. I wrote down on my Bible my name and that date when my name was sealed in the Lamb's Book of Life."</p>
        
        <p><strong>21.3</strong> "No, I'm not living like a Christian. No, I don't care anything for Christ or for his kingdom. But I said the words—they're legally binding. I'm his."</p>
        
        <p><strong>21.4</strong> No! Jesus says "the one who endures to the end." John says "they went out from us—why? Because they were not of us. That's why they went out—because they were not of us. If they had been of us, they would have remained."</p>
        
        <p><strong>21.5</strong> That's an evidence of salvation. Remaining is an evidence of salvation. Staying in the way, staying on the path, is evidence of salvation.</p>
        
        <p><strong>21.6</strong> We've already read that today in our confession: it's amazing how many times this sort of works itself out. We've already read today that believers can fall into sin—it can happen for a season. Amen. But if you belong to him...</p>
        
        <p><strong>21.7</strong> I love Revelation 3:19: "Those whom I love I reprove and discipline, therefore be zealous and repent." He's talking about believers.</p>
        
        <h3>Third Element: Two Crowds - Patient Endurance Required (40:50)</h3>
        <p><strong>22.1</strong> Look at chapter 24 of Matthew, beginning at verse 9: "Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. Then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another, and many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. But the one who endures to the end will be saved."</p>
        
        <p><strong>22.2</strong> Does that sound familiar?</p>
        
        <p><strong>22.3</strong> End of the road—that is marked with persecution and suffering. Does that mean that there will never be good days? No, it's not what that means at all.</p>
        
        <p><strong>22.4</strong> But in fact, you'll understand it better when you look at the next one. Remember we have the entrance, we have the path, and then we have the crowd.</p>
        
        <p><strong>22.5</strong> There are two different crowds. Look at what he says back in our passage in Matthew 7: "Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few."</p>
        
        <p><strong>22.6</strong> So one road has a large crowd, the other has but a few.</p>
        
        <p><strong>22.7</strong> Which means the Christian Life must be endured patiently—not just lived purposefully, but endured patiently.</p>
        
        <h3>The Challenge of Few Companions (41:35)</h3>
        <p><strong>23.1</strong> There are those who are going to be on a wide and easy way, and there are going to be days when it's extremely attractive to be there in order to be easy.</p>
        
        <p><strong>23.2</strong> Here's what would be easier: if the Christian Life looked like this—if over here there was a narrow gate and a narrow way, and we went through the narrow gate and we're walking on the narrow way, and while we're on that narrow way there's just a few people, but we're all in the same boat and we know it, and we have mutual strength and encouragement from one another, kind of like Sunday morning.</p>
        
        <p><strong>23.3</strong> But here's the problem: the Lord has not set up life so that those who walk on the narrow way don't have anything to do with those who walk on the broad way.</p>
        
        <p><strong>23.4</strong> Instead, it's more like this: we're on the narrow way and the broad way is all around us.</p>
        
        <p><strong>23.5</strong> One of the ways we know we're on a narrow way is that those who are on the broad way despise us.</p>
        
        <p><strong>23.6</strong> They despise us because of conviction—and again, not just because we're nasty people who deserve to be despised. That's not what I'm talking about here.</p>
        
        <p><strong>23.7</strong> But people don't like the light when they live in darkness. They don't like it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>23.8</strong> And they use phrases like "You're so narrow-minded." Well, I thank you very much. Really working on that.</p>
        
        <h3>Warning Against Making It Harder (43:21)</h3>
        <p><strong>24.1</strong> And let me just say a word here: the gate itself is narrow. We don't have to make it more narrow than it is. Can I say that again?</p>
        
        <p><strong>24.2</strong> The gate itself is narrow. We don't have to make it more narrow than it already is. That's the Pharisees.</p>
        
        <p><strong>24.3</strong> Now the gate is narrow, the path is hard. We don't have to make it harder than it already is.</p>
        
        <p><strong>24.4</strong> Our companions are already few. We don't have to make them fewer than they already are.</p>
        
        <p><strong>24.5</strong> Okay? Isolationism, legalism, all this sort of stuff—again, that has no place in what Jesus is speaking about here. It's not what he's talking about.</p>
        
        <p><strong>24.6</strong> But basically what he's saying to his followers is this: there's a narrow way, it's not easy to find, most people are not going to find it, most people are not even going to look for it because they're going to believe that they're on the right road.</p>
        
        <p><strong>24.7</strong> Some will believe it because they will believe the lie that says "all roads lead to God—you just need to find the one that works for you."</p>
        
        <p><strong>24.8</strong> You know what's wrong with that lie? It says that there are many roads when in fact there are only two.</p>
        
        <p><strong>24.9</strong> There's only two: there's Christ and his kingdom, and everybody else. That's it. That's all.</p>
        
        <h3>Why So Many Are on the Broad Road (45:01)</h3>
        <p><strong>25.1</strong> Our companions are few on this road. Why?</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.2</strong> Again, we talked about sin nature. I want you to look at a couple of things in Romans.</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.3</strong> Why is it that there are so many people on the broad road? Why is it that it is so difficult to find the narrow gate?</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.4</strong> Why is that? A couple of reasons. Number one: our sin nature. Look at Romans chapter 3, beginning in verse 10: "As it is written: 'None is righteous, no, not one; no one understands; no one seeks for God. All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one."</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.5</strong> "No one does good, not even one." By the way, he means that. He means that no one does good, not even one.</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.6</strong> There is not one person outside of being redeemed by Christ who's ever done anything that was truly good. Never.</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.7</strong> Because that which is not of faith is sin. Our righteousness is as filthy rags before his sight.</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.8</strong> So the fireman who risks his own life to run into a burning building to bring out the kid so that the kid doesn't die in the flames or suffocate in the smoke and brings the kid back—he's done something that from a human perspective is heroic, but apart from repentance and faith, apart from being born again, it is not good.</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.9</strong> Because it's not motivated by the glory of almighty God. It's not good.</p>
        
        <p><strong>25.10</strong> No one does good.</p>
        
        <h3>The Problem with Our Perspective (47:13)</h3>
        <p><strong>26.1</strong> And because we don't understand the doctrine of original sin, we have a hard time with the doctrine of the narrow gate and the hard way.</p>
        
        <p><strong>26.2</strong> Why? Because really we believe the opposite way around. We believe most people are good, and because of that, we believe most people are on their way to heaven when they die.</p>
        
        <p><strong>26.3</strong> In fact, we believe that there are only a few people—narrow is the gate that leads to hell—and there's only a few who find it: Hitler, Pol Pot, Manson.</p>
        
        <p><strong>26.4</strong> Most people, even people who go to church regularly, are only willing to name about six or seven people that they believe are going to go to hell. That's it. And they are the hit parade of the worst sinners in the history of the world.</p>
        
        <p><strong>26.5</strong> Nobody other than those people will the average person in church admit is going to die and be separated from God for eternity, because we honestly believe that most people are inherently good.</p>
        
        <p><strong>26.6</strong> Jesus says the exact opposite: people are wicked and they're evil, and there's very few people who ever find the narrow gate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>26.7</strong> It's difficult to find, not easy to find. It's hard to become a Christian and it's hard to be a Christian. It's not easy—neither one of those things is easy.</p>
        
        <h3>Human Depravity Described (48:46)</h3>
        <p><strong>27.1</strong> And here's why: "There's none of us good. Their throat is an open grave, they use their tongues to deceive, the venom of asps is under their lips, their mouth is full of curses and bitterness, their feet are swift to shed blood, in their paths are ruin and misery, and the way of peace they have not known. There is no fear of God before their eyes."</p>
        
        <p><strong>27.2</strong> That's their problem: there is no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>27.3</strong> They believe that if I run into a building and drag a kid out, I'm good. There is no fear of God that says regardless of what I do in my flesh, I am not, I will not be, and I have never been good before almighty God.</p>
        
        <p><strong>27.4</strong> No, we believe if you find a stranger's wallet and you turn it into the lost and found, you're good enough for God. If they give you too much change and you give the change back, you're good enough for God.</p>
        
        <p><strong>27.5</strong> It's not what the Bible teaches. We are ruined from the word go, every last one of us, and there is no fear of God before our eyes.</p>
        
        <p><strong>27.6</strong> And there are myriad motivations for doing those kind of things that have absolutely nothing to do with the converted life. Nothing whatsoever.</p>
        
        <p><strong>27.7</strong> We want to be good people, we want to be good citizens, we want to be heroes—whatever the case. Myriad reasons for doing those things that have nothing to do with the fear of God.</p>
        
        <h3>Original Sin Doctrine (50:15)</h3>
        <p><strong>28.1</strong> Well, here's the other issue: Romans chapter 5, beginning at verse 12: "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned..."</p>
        
        <p><strong>28.2</strong> That's the doctrine of original sin. Adam, our federal head, sinned, and when Adam our federal head sinned, he and all of his posterity fell with him.</p>
        
        <p><strong>28.3</strong> So all men are born with original sin, which is why—to go back to the beginning—there is no such thing, it is a theological impossibility for a person to have been a Christian for their entire life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>28.4</strong> Why? Because of the doctrine of original sin. You are born in sin, you are born turned away from God, and the wide path is the natural one for you because of your sin nature.</p>
        
        <p><strong>28.5</strong> Secondly, because of active rebellion—not only do you have a sinful nature, but you act on it. You act on it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>28.6</strong> Some of this in Ephesians 2: "And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you once walked"—you acted on it—"following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience, among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind."</p>
        
        <p><strong>28.7</strong> That's the nature of man. That's why it's hard to become a Christian. That's why it's hard to be a Christian. That's why it's hard to find the narrow gate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>28.8</strong> That's why people lie when they stand up and say "if you said these words, congratulations, you're in the family of God." That's a lie.</p>
        
        <p><strong>28.9</strong> You can say those words every day for the rest of your life and die and be separated from God.</p>
        
        <h3>The Deception of the Broad Road (52:36)</h3>
        <p><strong>29.1</strong> There are two gates, there are two paths, there are two crowds, and here's the problem: part of that broad road crowd is a group of people who go to church on a regular basis and use very familiar biblical language.</p>
        
        <p><strong>29.2</strong> They're crafty—the skin of truth surrounding the meat of a lie.</p>
        
        <p><strong>29.3</strong> And there are a lot of people on that broad road who have no idea that the broad road is what they're on. Why? Because somebody guaranteed them one day "you're no longer on the broad road—it's as easy as one, two, three, it's as easy as ABC," and all of a sudden they're walking on the broad road.</p>
        
        <p><strong>29.4</strong> And every once in a while they see a glimpse of that narrow path, they see a glimpse of that hard path, and they say "Wow, seems like they're on a different path than we're on."</p>
        
        <p><strong>29.5</strong> "Oh no, no, no, no, no, they're not. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, that's just a different kind of Christian path. They're just really committed, or they're overcommitted. They're taking it way too serious and going way too far with it."</p>
        
        <p><strong>29.6</strong> "Stay here on the broad road, because after all, do you really believe that we're not doing what's right when there are thousands of people who are coming to our church and dozens of people getting saved every week?"</p>
        
        <p><strong>29.7</strong> "How can we be on the broad road if people are walking to the front of the aisle with tears streaming down their face praying the sinner's prayer? How can we be on the broad road if that's what's happening? How can we be wrong if God is blessing our work like that?"</p>
        
        <p><strong>29.8</strong> Does any of this sound familiar, folks? Unfortunately, it's broad road language.</p>
        
        <h3>Fourth Element: Two Destinations - Faithful Completion Required (55:04)</h3>
        <p><strong>30.1</strong> Finally, there are two destinations, which shows us that the Christian Life must be completed faithfully.</p>
        
        <p><strong>30.2</strong> It must be completed faithfully. Those who endure to the end will be saved.</p>
        
        <p><strong>30.3</strong> Now here's the good news: endurance is evidence of your salvation. It's not evidence of you having earned it. Amen.</p>
        
        <p><strong>30.4</strong> But my endurance, my endurance to the end, my coming to the gates of glory, my coming to life everlasting, will not be a result of any sort of shared credit between me and Jesus.</p>
        
        <p><strong>30.5</strong> So when I get to heaven, here's what it won't look like: I won't walk in and give Jesus a high five and say "Man, I'm so glad that you started that thing for me, but did you see how I carried it through? That was awesome, wasn't it? That last few yards—I mean years—you know, I really did it! I brought it home! I dove across the goal line! You did real good though, Jesus. I'm so glad, I mean, you know, dying for me thing and stuff like that—that part I never could have done, but the rest of it..."</p>
        
        <p><strong>30.6</strong> How foolish is that? It's absolutely foolish.</p>
        
        <p><strong>30.7</strong> He who began a good work in you is the one who is able to see it through to completion. He is the author and the finisher of our faith. He is the one who works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.</p>
        
        <p><strong>30.8</strong> So my endurance in the faith is not evidence that I'm doing really good at holding on to Christ, but it's evidence that Christ is holding on to me.</p>
        
        <h3>The Problem with False Assurance (57:06)</h3>
        <p><strong>31.1</strong> Endurance. That's why he says "Watch yourselves, test yourselves to see that you're in the faith." Test yourselves.</p>
        
        <p><strong>31.2</strong> Here's one of the big problems with the way the gospel is polluted in our culture: people proclaim the quasi-gospel, come down to the sinner's prayer that you will never, ever, ever find in the Bible, have somebody repeat this flimsy prayer, tell them that based on the words that just came out of their mouth they're saved and they belong to God, they're sealed in the Lamb's Book of Life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>31.3</strong> And if a person is unconverted, they've just been sealed in their unbelief.</p>
        
        <p><strong>31.4</strong> And here's what's so terrible about that: years later, when they ought to be on their faces—remember, "test yourself to see if you be in the faith"—years later when they ought to be on their faces basically saying "You know what? Yeah, I prayed that, but I was manipulated. Yeah, I meant that, but I was scared. There was no repentance, there was no conversion, there was nothing. God, I need to cry out to you and confess that I'm not yours."</p>
        
        <p><strong>31.5</strong> "I've been going to church, I've been going through the motions, I've been doing all sorts of things, and this hasn't been hard because I'm on the hard road—no, it's hard because I'm on the broad road trying to convince myself that I'm a Christian."</p>
        
        <p><strong>31.6</strong> But that never happens. Why doesn't it happen? Because here's what you do: you remember this for the rest of your days—you go back to your Bible, you open it up to that page, you point to that date, and you remember that on that date, because of what you said with your mouth, your name was written in the Lamb's Book of Life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>31.7</strong> So there's no need for you to fall on your face in repentance before a holy God, crushed under the weight of your sin, because your salvation is not about your endurance, your salvation is not about fruit, your salvation is just about the words that you say in the magic part of the room.</p>
        
        <p><strong>31.8</strong> Do you see how destructive that is? How heinous that is? And that's what passes for the gospel in our day.</p>
        
        <h3>Jesus's Final Warning (59:21)</h3>
        <p><strong>32.1</strong> Here Jesus stands basically warning us, pleading with us: if you've heard what I said, then here's what you do with it—enter the narrow gate.</p>
        
        <p><strong>32.2</strong> There's a broad gate out there and there's an easy road out there, and because of your sin nature and your active rebellion, that's the one that you'll naturally find.</p>
        
        <p><strong>32.3</strong> But this one that I'm talking about, it's difficult to find, and if you're not careful, you won't find it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>32.4</strong> And what's worse, you may even be deceived in thinking that you're on it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>32.5</strong> Listen to what Calvin says commenting on this passage: "As nothing is more opposed to the flesh than the doctrine of Christ, no man will ever make great proficiency in it who has not learned to confine his senses and feelings so as to keep them within those boundaries which our heavenly teacher prescribes for curbing our wantonness."</p>
        
        <p><strong>32.6</strong> "As men willingly flatter themselves and live in guilty dissipation, Christ here reminds his disciples that they must prepare to walk, as it were, along a narrow and thorny road."</p>
        
        <p><strong>32.7</strong> "But as it is difficult to restrain our desires from wicked licentiousness and disorder, he soothes this bitterness by a joyful remuneration when he tells us that the narrow gate and the narrow road lead to life."</p>
        
        <h3>The Hope: Life at the End (1:01:05)</h3>
        <p><strong>33.1</strong> That's just good. Calvin says it's so hard to be a Christian, we so want the broad road, that unless we continue to make ourselves mindful of this, we're drawn away.</p>
        
        <p><strong>33.2</strong> But God is so good, because here's what he's given us: Jesus doesn't just say "narrow gate, hard road." He could have. "Narrow gate, hard road." He says "narrow gate, hard road, few companions, but oh, by the way, hang on—because at the end there's life."</p>
        
        <p><strong>33.3</strong> And only at the end of this one is there life. Nowhere else is there life—not even the parts of the broad road that have been made to resemble the narrow path. Not even there is there life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>33.4</strong> There is only life in the narrow gate, in the hard road marked with persecution and suffering where your companions are few. Only there do you have the assurance that at the end of it there is life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>33.5</strong> Can your entrance be easier? Yes, it can. Can your road be easier? Yes, it can. Can your companions be more numerous? Yes, they can. But can you have that and end up at life? No, you may not.</p>
        
        <p><strong>33.6</strong> It's an either/or proposition: narrow gate, hard road, few companions, and life—or broad gate, easy road, many companions, and destruction.</p>
        
        <h3>Jesus's Final Appeal (1:03:15)</h3>
        <p><strong>34.1</strong> Jesus basically comes to the end of his sermon and says "In case what I've already said to you hasn't made you aware enough of how radically different this is and how unbelievably not just difficult but impossible this is, let me make it as plain as I possibly can."</p>
        
        <p><strong>34.2</strong> "I'm putting before you a narrow gate. I'm putting before you a hard road marked with pain and suffering and persecution. I'm putting in front of you the way not taken by many, or the road less traveled if you prefer."</p>
        
        <p><strong>34.3</strong> "But it's okay, because the good news is I'm putting before you life."</p>
        
        <p><strong>34.4</strong> Almost echoing Moses: "I put before you today life and death. Choose life."</p>
        
        <h3>Final Exhortation and Call to Repentance (1:04:22)</h3>
        <p><strong>35.1</strong> I'll leave you with this from James Montgomery Boice: "This is an important word for you if you are drifting along in your religion, even if your religion is Christianity. Do not assume you're on the way that leads to life unless you are actually pursuing it in obedience to Christ. Jesus did not teach that it would be easy either to become a Christian or to be a Christian. He said it would be difficult. Anything worthwhile is."</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.2</strong> Test yourself. See if you be in the faith. Test yourself to see if you've chosen the narrow gate, the hard road, few companions, but life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.3</strong> Test yourself, and then when you test yourself, make sure that you enter the narrow gate—that you enter through repentance and faith.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.4</strong> Repentance because you understand that you are a sinner, a wretched one in both nature and deed, and that you deserve that which a holy and righteous God must give to those who sin, and that is his wrath and eternal punishment.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.5</strong> That's repentance. Repentance is recognizing that. Repentance is self-abhorrency, as the confession says. Repentance is being so sick of yourself that you can't stand yourself and you want to get away from yourself, because you recognize that everything in you is filthy and wretched and does not deserve to be in the presence of a holy God.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.6</strong> And you turn from that and cry out to the only one who can make you any different. That's repentance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.7</strong> Repentance and faith. Faith in what? Faith in the Jesus of the Scriptures. Faith in the God-man. Faith in the one who was born of a virgin. Faith in the one who performed miracles. Faith in the one who died on a cross. Faith in the one who rose again on the third day. Faith in the one who's coming again to judge the living and the dead. Faith in the only one who's an answer to the sin problem from which you are in repentance.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.8</strong> Faith in that one. Faith in him alone and his completed work—not his work and yours, but his work alone. That's faith. That's faith—not just the name, but the person and work of Jesus Christ.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.9</strong> When you grasp repentance like that and when you grasp faith like that, then you understand the narrow road, the narrow gate, the hard road. Only then.</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.10</strong> If you think it's easy and that you can continue to be who you are and that somehow because you say a few words that makes you okay with God...</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.11</strong> If you think that because you are comparatively less wicked than the people around you and that somehow that means you're worthy of heaven...</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.12</strong> If you think that because somehow you have not been as awful and as wicked as the Hitlers of the world and the Mansons of the world and that somehow that means that God's going to grade on a curve...</p>
        
        <p><strong>35.13</strong> Then you have not found the narrow gate.</p>
        
        <h3>Closing Call (1:08:01)</h3>
        <p><strong>36.1</strong> Repent. Place your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Cry out to him that he might save you and forgive you of your sins.</p>
        
        <p><strong>36.2</strong> Enter the narrow gate. Walk the hard road—the one with few companions—because then and only then will you find life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>36.3</strong> Let's pray.</p>
        
        <h3>Closing Prayer (1:08:36)</h3>
        <p><strong>37.1</strong> Father, as we bow before you, we confess that we are a wretched lot, and even worse than that, we are a wretched lot that doesn't like to admit it.</p>
        
        <p><strong>37.2</strong> We're wicked from the word go and absolutely bent toward the broad gate and the easy road.</p>
        
        <p><strong>37.3</strong> But thanks be to God for Jesus Christ our Lord, who has come to redeem a people for himself—a people marked by repentance and faith, a people who enter the narrow gate and walk the hard road with few companions and find life.</p>
        
        <p><strong>37.4</strong> Grant that we might test ourselves to see if we're in the faith. Grant that we might examine ourselves and never cease to do so, unless and until we have reached the ultimate end of that hard road and life everlasting.</p>
