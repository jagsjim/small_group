            <h1>üìú Session 1: The Problem and the Promise</h1>
            <h2>God's Covenants and Humanity's Failure</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 30px; margin-top: 30px;">A journey through the early Old Testament that reveals why we desperately need a Savior</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 2: Welcome -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">2/95</div>
            <h2>Welcome Friends! üëã</h2>
            <p>Tonight we're going to walk through an incredible journey - from creation through the wilderness wanderings. I know that sounds like a lot, but we're going to see how every story, every character, and every covenant points to one thing: our desperate need for Jesus.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">By the end of tonight, you'll see the Bible not as a collection of random stories, but as one unified love story from God to you.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 3: The Big Picture -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">3/95</div>
            <h2>The Incredible Unity of Scripture üìö</h2>
            <p>Think about this for a moment: The Bible contains 66 different books, written by 40 different authors, over a span of 1,500 years. These writers came from every walk of life - kings, fishermen, tax collectors, shepherds, doctors.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Yet somehow, these 66 books tell <span class="highlight">ONE unified story about ONE hero: Jesus Christ.</span> That's not humanly possible - it's divine!</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 4: Love Letter Metaphor - Expanded -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">4/95</div>
            <h2>God's Love Letters to You üíï</h2>
            <p>Here's my favorite way to understand the Bible. Imagine an arranged marriage in ancient times. A young woman has never met her future husband, but he begins writing her letters. Letter after letter arrives, each one revealing more about his character, his love for her, his plans for their future together.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">By the time their wedding day arrives, she feels like she already knows him. She's fallen in love through his words. <span class="highlight">That's exactly what God is doing through Scripture</span> - preparing us to meet our Bridegroom face to face!</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 5: Time Marker -->
        <div class="slide time-marker">
            <div class="slide-number">5/95</div>
            <div class="time-indicator">‚è∞ 4 min</div>
            <h1>üôè Opening Prayer</h1>
            <p style="font-style: italic;">Father, open our eyes tonight to see the beauty of Your story. Help us understand not just the facts, but feel the weight of humanity's failure and the wonder of Your faithful love. In Jesus' name, Amen.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 6: God-Breathed -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">6/95</div>
            <h2>Every Word Matters üìñ</h2>
            <div class="scripture">
                "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness"
                <br><em>- 2 Timothy 3:16</em>
            </div>
            <p>When we say "God-breathed," we mean that God Himself inspired every word. The human authors wrote in their own style, but God superintended the process so that what they wrote was exactly what He wanted to communicate to us.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 7: What This Means -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">7/95</div>
            <h2>Why This Matters to You</h2>
            <p>If the Bible is just human wisdom, we can take it or leave it. But if it's actually God's Word, then it has authority over our lives. It's not just ancient history - it's God speaking to you today.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Tonight, as we walk through these stories, remember: this isn't about people who lived long ago. <span class="highlight">This is about you and me and our relationship with God.</span></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 8: Hesed Love Introduction -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">8/95</div>
            <h2>A Word That Changes Everything: HESED ‚ù§Ô∏è</h2>
            <p>Before we dive into the stories, I need to teach you one Hebrew word that will transform how you read the Bible: <span class="highlight">hesed</span> (pronounced "HEH-sed").</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">This word appears over 240 times in the Old Testament, and English Bibles usually translate it as "steadfast love" or "lovingkindness." But those translations don't capture its full meaning.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 9: Hesed Defined -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">9/95</div>
            <h2>What Hesed Really Means</h2>
            <p>Hesed is covenant love - the kind of love that makes promises and keeps them no matter what. It's not based on feelings or circumstances. It's loyal, faithful, unbreakable love.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">When God says He has hesed love for you, He's saying: <span class="highlight">"I have bound Myself to you with an unbreakable promise, and nothing you do can make Me let go."</span></p>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 10: Covenant Definition -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">10/95</div>
            <h2>What Is a Covenant? ü§ù</h2>
            <p>A covenant is more than a contract. A contract is about exchanging goods or services - if you break it, you pay a penalty and move on. But a covenant is about relationship. It's a binding promise between persons who pledge loyalty to each other.</p>
            <div class="quote">
                "A covenant is a sacred bond, sovereignly administered, with life-and-death consequences" - R.C. Sproul
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 11: Two Types -->
        <div class="slide">
            <div class="slide-number">11/95</div>
            <h2>Two Types of Covenants</h2>
            <div class="covenant-box">
                <p><strong>Conditional Covenants:</strong> "If you do this, then I'll do that." These depend on both parties keeping their promises.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><strong>Unconditional Covenants:</strong> "I will do this, period." These depend only on the promise-maker, not the recipient.</p>
            </div>
            <p style="margin-top: 25px;">Watch for this pattern tonight - it becomes very important!</p>

            <div class="story-text">
                <p>Picture this: God creates a perfect world. No death, no pain, no struggle. He forms Adam from the dust and breathes life into him. God plants a gorgeous garden in Eden and puts Adam there to work it and care for it.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Then God says, "It's not good for man to be alone," so He creates Eve from Adam's rib - bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh. They're naked and feel no shame. Perfect intimacy with each other and with God.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Slide 14: Everything Was Very Good -->
        <div class="slide">

            <p>Not just "good" - VERY good! Perfect harmony between God and humanity, husband and wife, humans and creation. This is what we were made for - unbroken fellowship with God and each other.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Think about this - Noah likely had never seen rain (Genesis 2:6 suggests the earth was watered by mist). Yet God says build a boat 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. That's one and a half football fields long!</p>

            <p>It probably took Noah decades to build the ark. Every day, as he worked, people would have mocked him. "Crazy Noah, building a boat where there's no water!" But Noah kept building and kept preaching, warning people that judgment was coming.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">God was patient - He gave humanity 120 years to repent while Noah built. But no one listened except Noah's family.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;"><span class="highlight">This shows us how seriously God takes sin.</span> He is patient and merciful, but He is also holy and just. Sin cannot remain in His presence.</p>

            <p>Yet even in this devastating judgment, God showed mercy. He saved Noah's family - eight people total. He preserved two of every kind of animal. He didn't completely destroy His creation.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Why? Because God still had a plan. Remember that promise in the garden about the woman's offspring crushing the serpent? That promise was still in effect. The Savior would come through Noah's line.</p>

            </div>
            <p>God gives Abraham a sign - circumcision. Every male descendant would bear this mark. Unlike the rainbow (in the sky), this sign is on their bodies - a permanent reminder that they belong to God.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Later, Paul explains that what really matters is <span class="highlight">"circumcision of the heart"</span> - an inward change that only God can perform!</p>

            <p>Years later, God tests Abraham with the most difficult command imaginable: "Take your son, your only son, whom you love‚ÄîIsaac‚Äîand go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering."</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">This is the son Abraham waited 25 years for! The son through whom all the promises would come! How could God ask this?</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Abraham's heart must have been breaking as he answers: "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." More prophetic than Abraham knew!</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Abraham looks up and sees a ram caught in a thicket. God HAD provided the sacrifice! The ram dies instead of Isaac.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 25px;"><span class="highlight">Because the true Lamb was still to come.</span> Every ram and lamb sacrificed from that day forward would point to Jesus, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Jacob tricks Esau into selling his birthright for a bowl of stew, then later deceives his blind father Isaac to steal Esau's blessing. Jacob's name means "deceiver" - and he lives up to it!</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">The man blesses him and changes his name from Jacob (deceiver) to Israel (one who strives with God). Jacob realizes he's been wrestling with God Himself! <span class="highlight">The deceiver becomes the father of God's chosen nation.</span></p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">To make matters worse, Joseph has dreams where his brothers' sheaves of grain bow down to his sheaf, and where the sun, moon, and eleven stars bow down to him. He naively tells his brothers these dreams. They hate him even more.</p>

            <p>That terrible night, Pharaoh's own son dies. Finally broken, he not only lets Israel go but begs them to leave. The Egyptians give them gold, silver, and clothing - 400 years of back wages! About 600,000 men plus women and children leave Egypt.</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">But Pharaoh changes his mind one more time and pursues them with his army...</p>

            <p>Moses stretches out his staff, and God drives the sea back with a strong east wind all night. The waters divide, creating walls of water on both sides. The Israelites walk through on dry ground!</p>
            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">When the Egyptians pursue, the waters return and Pharaoh's entire army drowns. <span class="highlight">God fights for His people!</span></p>

            <p>God brings His people to Mount Sinai. The mountain is covered with smoke and fire, thundering and quaking. God is about to make a covenant with His people. He gives Moses the Ten Commandments and many other laws.</p>
            <div class="covenant-box">

            <p>The Law wasn't given to save them - they were already saved by the Passover lamb's blood! The Law was given to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Show them how to live as God's people</li>
                <li>Set them apart from other nations</li>

            </div>
            <p>God gives Moses detailed instructions for a portable temple where His presence will dwell. Every part of the tabernacle points forward to Jesus - the gate (only one way in), the altar (sacrifice for sin), the bread (bread of life), the lampstand (light of the world)!</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">They're breaking the first two commandments while Moses is still receiving them! This shows the heart of humanity's problem - we cannot keep God's law on our own.</p>

                <p>After leaving Mount Sinai, they finally reach the edge of the Promised Land - the land God promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Moses sends twelve spies (one from each tribe) to scout out the land.</p>
                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">After 40 days, the spies return with a cluster of grapes so large it takes two men to carry it! The land truly flows with milk and honey, just as God promised. But then comes the bad news...</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">But two spies - Joshua and Caleb - have a different perspective: "The land we passed through is exceedingly good. If the Lord delights in us, He will bring us into this land and give it to us!"</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">They even talk about choosing a new leader and going back to Egypt - back to slavery! After all God has done - the plagues, the Passover, parting the Red Sea, providing manna - they still don't trust Him.</p>

            <p>God declares that this entire generation will wander in the wilderness for 40 years - one year for each day the spies were in the land. Everyone 20 years old and older will die in the wilderness, except Joshua and Caleb who trusted God.</p>

                <p style="margin-top: 20px;">One by one, the generation that saw God's mighty works in Egypt dies off. Even Moses' sister Miriam and brother Aaron die in the wilderness. An entire generation perishes because of unbelief.</p>

            <p style="margin-top: 20px;">Water gushes out, but God says to Moses: "Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy in the sight of the Israelites, you will not bring this community into the land I give them."</p>
