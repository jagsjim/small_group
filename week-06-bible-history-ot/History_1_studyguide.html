    <h1>üìú Session 1: Garden to Wilderness</h1>
    <p class="center italic">God's Covenants and Humanity's Failure</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h2>üìö Welcome Friends!</h2>
    
    <p>Tonight we're going to walk through an incredible journey - from creation through the wilderness wanderings. I know that sounds like a lot, but we're going to see how every story, every character, and every covenant points to one thing: our desperate need for Jesus.</p>
    
    <p>By the end of tonight, you'll see the Bible not as a collection of random stories, but as one unified love story from God to you.</p>
    
    <p>Here's something that will blow your mind: The Bible contains <span class="bold">66 books, written by 40 different authors over 1,500 years.</span> These writers came from every walk of life - kings, fishermen, tax collectors, shepherds, doctors. Yet these 66 books tell <span class="highlight">ONE unified story about ONE hero: Jesus Christ.</span> That's not humanly possible - it's divine!</p>
    
    <p>Here's my favorite way to understand the Bible: It's God's love letter to you. Imagine an arranged marriage in ancient times. A young woman has never met her future husband, but he begins writing her letters. Letter after letter arrives, each one revealing more about his character, his love for her, his plans for their future together. By the time their wedding day arrives, she feels like she already knows him. She's fallen in love through his words. <span class="highlight">That's exactly what God is doing through Scripture</span> - preparing us to meet our Bridegroom face to face!</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness" - 2 Timothy 3:16
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üôè Opening Prayer (4 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>ü§ù Understanding God's Covenant Heart</h2>
    
    <h3>A Word That Changes Everything: HESED</h3>
    
    <p>Before we dive into the stories, I need to teach you one Hebrew word that will transform how you read the Bible: <span class="highlight">hesed</span> (pronounced "HEH-sed").</p>
    
    <p>This word appears over 240 times in the Old Testament, and English Bibles usually translate it as "steadfast love" or "lovingkindness." But those translations don't capture its full meaning. Hesed is covenant love - the kind of love that makes promises and keeps them no matter what. It's not based on feelings or circumstances. It's loyal, faithful, unbreakable love.</p>
    
    <p>When God says He has hesed love for you, He's saying: <span class="highlight">"I have bound Myself to you with an unbreakable promise, and nothing you do can make Me let go."</span></p>
    
    <h3>What Is a Covenant?</h3>
    
    <p>A covenant is more than a contract. A contract is about exchanging goods or services - if you break it, you pay a penalty and move on. But a covenant is about relationship. It's a binding promise between persons who pledge loyalty to each other.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "A covenant is a sacred bond, sovereignly administered, with life-and-death consequences" - R.C. Sproul
    </div>
    
    <h3>Two Types of Covenants</h3>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <p><span class="bold">Conditional covenants:</span> "If you do this, then I'll do that." These depend on both parties keeping their promises.</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Unconditional covenants:</span> "I will do this, period." These depend only on the promise-maker, not the recipient.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Watch for this pattern tonight - it becomes very important!</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üçé The First Covenant and Failure (10 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üåÖ Adam & Eve: Paradise Lost</h2>
    
    <p>Picture this: God creates a perfect world. No death, no pain, no struggle. He forms Adam from the dust and breathes life into him. God plants a gorgeous garden in Eden and puts Adam there to work it and care for it.</p>
    
    <p>Then God says, "It's not good for man to be alone," so He creates Eve from Adam's rib - bone of his bone, flesh of his flesh. They're naked and feel no shame. Perfect intimacy with each other and with God.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good" - Genesis 1:31
    </div>
    
    <p>Not just "good" - VERY good! Perfect harmony between God and humanity, husband and wife, humans and creation. This is what we were made for - unbroken fellowship with God and each other.</p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">The Creation Covenant:</span> Enjoy this perfect world, rule over it with love, have relationship with Me, but don't eat from one tree. God gave them everything - an entire garden of delicious fruit! Just one tree was off limits. This wasn't God being mean. He was asking them to trust Him, to accept that He knows what's best.</p>
    
    <p>But then came the heartbreak. The serpent comes to Eve with a lie: "You won't die! God knows that when you eat it, you'll become like Him." The temptation: You can be your own god. You don't need to trust Him.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "She took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it" - Genesis 3:6
    </div>
    
    <p>In that moment, everything changed. The first covenant was shattered by human disobedience. Death entered the world. When God came walking in the garden, Adam and Eve hid. Instead of taking responsibility, Adam blames Eve AND God: "The woman YOU put here with me gave me the fruit."</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>But God's First Promise!</h3>
    
    <p>Even in judgment, God made a promise. Genesis 3:15 says the woman's offspring would crush the serpent's head. This is the first glimpse of a Savior! One day, a descendant of the woman would crush the serpent's head. Yes, the serpent would wound him ("strike his heel"), but the serpent would be defeated. <span class="highlight">This is the first promise of Jesus!</span></p>
    
    <h3>God Teaches the First Sacrifice</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them." - Genesis 3:21
    </div>
    
    <p>Don't miss this! To make garments of skin, animals had to die. This is the first death in God's perfect world - innocent animals dying to cover human shame. God Himself performs the first sacrifice, teaching them that sin brings death, but He will provide a covering. <span class="highlight">Every animal sacrifice from this point forward points to Jesus, the ultimate sacrifice.</span></p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "The first grain of incense that ever smoked upon the altar of promise was this earliest word of hope" - Charles Spurgeon
    </div>
    
    <h3>From Bad to Worse</h3>
    
    <p>Things spiral downward quickly. Adam and Eve's son Cain becomes jealous of his brother Abel. God accepts Abel's sacrifice but rejects Cain's. Why? Abel brought the best of his flock in faith; Cain just brought "some" of his crops - no faith, no heart in it. Cain murders Abel - the first human death is a brother killing a brother.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time" - Genesis 6:5
    </div>
    
    <div class="discussion-box">
        <span class="bold">üí≠ Discussion Moment:</span> Adam and Eve had everything they could possibly want in a perfect paradise, yet they still chose to disobey God for the one thing He said no to. Why do you think we as humans always seem to want the one thing we can't have?
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üåà Noah: God's Judgment and Mercy (6 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>‚õµ When God Started Over</h2>
    
    <p>In a world gone completely evil, one man stood out: Noah. The Bible says he "found favor in the eyes of the Lord" and "walked faithfully with God." God comes to Noah with an unbelievable assignment: build a massive boat because He's going to flood the entire earth.</p>
    
    <p>Think about this - Noah likely had never seen rain (Genesis 2:6 suggests the earth was watered by mist). Yet God says build a boat 450 feet long! That's one and a half football fields!</p>
    
    <p>It probably took Noah decades to build the ark. Every day, people would have mocked him. But Noah kept building and kept preaching. God was patient - He gave humanity 120 years to repent. But no one listened except Noah's family.</p>
    
    <p>We often see cute pictures of Noah's ark with smiling animals. But this was the most devastating judgment in human history. Every person outside the ark died. <span class="highlight">This shows us how seriously God takes sin.</span> He is patient and merciful, but He is also holy and just.</p>
    
    <p>Yet even in this devastating judgment, God showed mercy. He saved Noah's family - eight people total. Why? Because God still had a plan. Remember that promise in the garden about the woman's offspring crushing the serpent? The Savior would come through Noah's line.</p>
    
    <h3>The Rainbow Promise</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth... Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life." - Genesis 9:13,15
    </div>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <span class="bold">First UNCONDITIONAL Covenant!</span> God didn't say "IF you're good, I won't flood the earth." He simply promised, period. The rainbow is God's signature on an unbreakable promise.
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üóº Tower of Babel (2 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üèóÔ∏è Pride vs. God's Mission</h2>
    
    <p>God told Noah's descendants to "fill the earth." But they had other ideas. They settled in one place and said, "Let's build a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens, so that we may make a name for ourselves."</p>
    
    <p>Notice their motivation: make a name for OURSELVES. God comes down to see their tower (there's humor here - their "sky-high" tower is so small God has to come down to see it!). He confuses their language so they can't understand each other. They scatter across the earth - exactly what they were trying to avoid.</p>
    
    <p>At this point, things look hopeless. Humanity keeps failing. But notice: <span class="highlight">the very next chapter introduces Abraham.</span> When humanity creates division, God begins His plan to bless ALL nations through one family.</p>
    
    <div class="time-marker">‚≠ê Abraham: Father of Faith (11 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üë®‚Äçü¶≥ God's World-Changing Promise</h2>
    
    <p>Abram (later renamed Abraham) is living in Ur, a prosperous city. He's 75 years old, settled, comfortable. Then God speaks: "Leave your country, your people and your father's household and go to the land I will show you."</p>
    
    <p>No GPS coordinates. No travel brochure. Just "go to the land I will show you." And here's the amazing part - Abraham went!</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you" - Genesis 12:2-3
    </div>
    
    <p>Look at that last line: <span class="highlight">"ALL peoples on earth will be blessed through you."</span> That includes you and me! This wasn't just about Abraham - it was about God's plan to rescue the whole world.</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>25 Years of Waiting</h3>
    
    <p>God promises to make Abraham into a great nation. But Abraham is 75 years old and his wife Sarah is 65 - and they have no children. Sarah is barren. How can you become a great nation without any kids?</p>
    
    <p>Years pass. No baby. They try to help God out - Sarah gives her servant Hagar to Abraham. Ishmael is born, but God says, "No, Sarah will have a son." More years pass. Abraham is now 99, Sarah is 89. Then three visitors appear and say, "By this time next year, Sarah will have a son." Sarah laughs - she's nearly 90!</p>
    
    <p>But God keeps His promise! At age 90, Sarah gives birth to Isaac. His name means "laughter." Twenty-five years of waiting, but God's timing was perfect. Abraham learned that <span class="highlight">God's delays are not God's denials.</span></p>
    
    <h3>God Makes Covenant with Himself</h3>
    
    <p>In Genesis 15, God formally makes a covenant with Abraham. In ancient times, both parties would walk between cut animal pieces, saying, "May this happen to me if I break this covenant." But God puts Abraham into a deep sleep. Only God passes between the pieces.</p>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        God is saying: "This covenant depends on Me alone. You can't break it because you're not even awake!" This is an unconditional covenant based entirely on God's faithfulness!
    </div>
    
    <h3>The Ultimate Test</h3>
    
    <p>Years later, God tests Abraham: "Take your son, your only son, whom you love‚ÄîIsaac‚Äîand go to the region of Moriah. Sacrifice him there as a burnt offering."</p>
    
    <p>Picture this scene: Abraham, over 100 years old, walking up Mount Moriah with his beloved son. Isaac carries the wood for his own sacrifice. Isaac asks, "Father, where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son" - Genesis 22:8
    </div>
    
    <p>More prophetic than Abraham knew!</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>God Provides the Substitute!</h3>
    
    <p>Abraham builds the altar, arranges the wood, binds Isaac, and raises the knife. At the last second, an angel stops him. Abraham looks up and sees a ram caught in a thicket. God HAD provided the sacrifice! The ram dies instead of Isaac.</p>
    
    <p>This whole event was a preview of the gospel!</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Isaac was the beloved son</span> ‚Üí Jesus is God's beloved Son</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Isaac carried the wood</span> ‚Üí Jesus carried His cross</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Isaac was willing to be sacrificed</span> ‚Üí Jesus willingly gave His life</li>
        <li><span class="bold">God provided a substitute ram</span> ‚Üí God provided Jesus as our substitute</li>
        <li><span class="bold">This happened on Mount Moriah</span> ‚Üí The very mountain where Jerusalem's temple would later stand!</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Abraham names that place "The Lord Will Provide." He had told Isaac, "God will provide the lamb," but God provided a ram. Why? <span class="highlight">Because the true Lamb was still to come.</span> Every ram and lamb sacrificed from that day forward would point to Jesus!</p>
    
    <div class="discussion-box">
        <span class="bold">üí≠ Discussion Moment:</span> God made Abraham wait 25 years for Isaac, but He kept His promise. What encourages you most about Abraham's story - his faith or God's faithfulness?

    <div class="time-marker">üåæ The Covenant Family Grows (7 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üë®‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶ Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph</h2>
    
    <p>Isaac marries Rebekah and they have twin boys: Esau and Jacob. God had told Rebekah before they were born: "The older will serve the younger." Jacob tricks Esau into selling his birthright for a bowl of stew, then later deceives his blind father Isaac to steal Esau's blessing. Jacob's name means "deceiver" - and he lives up to it!</p>
    
    <p>Years later, when returning home, Jacob wrestles with God all night. God changes his name from Jacob (deceiver) to Israel (one who strives with God). <span class="highlight">The deceiver becomes the father of God's chosen nation.</span></p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <p>Israel has twelve sons who become the twelve tribes of Israel. But there's major family dysfunction. Israel loves Rachel's son Joseph more than all his other sons, giving him a richly ornamented robe. Joseph has dreams where his brothers bow down to him. They hate him for it.</p>
    
    <h3>Sold Into Slavery</h3>
    
    <p>The brothers sell Joseph as a slave for twenty shekels of silver. They tell their father that Joseph was killed by a wild animal. Joseph ends up in Egypt, where he's falsely accused and thrown into prison.</p>
    
    <p>But "the Lord was with Joseph." Through interpreting dreams, Joseph goes from prisoner to prime minister of Egypt in one day! When famine hits, his brothers come to Egypt for food and bow before him - not recognizing it's Joseph! The dreams come true.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" - Genesis 50:20
    </div>
    
    <p>Joseph invites his entire family - 70 people total - to move to Egypt. <span class="highlight">What seemed like disaster after disaster was actually God positioning His people exactly where they needed to be.</span></p>
    
    <p>Look at the parallels between Joseph and Jesus:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Beloved son ‚Üí Jesus was the Father's beloved Son</li>

    <h2>üîó From Slavery to Freedom</h2>
    
    <p>Joseph's family of 70 grows into a nation of perhaps 2 million. But a new Pharaoh arises "who did not know about Joseph." Fearing their numbers, he enslaves them. For 400 years, they suffer under brutal oppression. Pharaoh even orders all Hebrew baby boys to be thrown into the Nile!</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <p>One Hebrew mother hides her baby boy for three months, then places him in a waterproof basket in the Nile. Pharaoh's daughter finds him and adopts him, naming him Moses ("drawn out of the water"). Ironically, the future deliverer of Israel is raised in Pharaoh's own household!</p>
    
    <p>At age 40, Moses kills an Egyptian beating a Hebrew slave and has to flee. For the next 40 years, he's a shepherd in the wilderness. At age 80, when Moses thinks his life is basically over, God appears in a burning bush:</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "I have indeed seen the misery of my people in Egypt. I have heard them crying out... So I have come down to rescue them... So now, go. I am sending you to Pharaoh" - Exodus 3:7-10
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob" - Exodus 2:24
    </div>
    
    <p>When the Bible says God "remembers," it doesn't mean He forgot. It means He's about to act on His promises. <span class="highlight">400 years of silence, but God was preparing the perfect moment for deliverance.</span></p>
    
    <h3>The Plagues and Passover</h3>
    
    <p>Moses confronts Pharaoh: "Let my people go!" Pharaoh refuses. What follows is not just a power struggle - each plague is a direct attack on Egypt's gods, showing that the Lord is supreme!</p>
    
    <p>Finally, God announces the most terrible plague: the death of every firstborn. But He provides a way of escape - the Passover. Each family must sacrifice a perfect lamb and put its blood on their doorframes. When the destroyer sees the blood, he will "pass over" that house.</p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">Do you see Jesus here?</span> A perfect lamb dies so that death passes over God's people. The lamb must be without defect, examined for 4 days, no bones broken - every detail points to Jesus!</p>
    
    <p>That terrible night, Pharaoh's own son dies. Finally broken, he lets Israel go. But he changes his mind and pursues them. Trapped between Pharaoh's army and the Red Sea, Moses stretches out his staff. God parts the sea! The Israelites walk through on dry ground. When the Egyptians pursue, the waters return and Pharaoh's entire army drowns.</p>

    <div class="time-marker">üìú Mount Sinai and the Law (5 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>‚õ∞Ô∏è A Conditional Covenant</h2>
    
    <p>God brings His people to Mount Sinai. The mountain is covered with smoke and fire, thundering and quaking. God is about to make a covenant with His people.</p>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <span class="bold">The Mosaic Covenant - CONDITIONAL:</span> "If you obey me fully and keep my covenant, then out of all nations you will be my treasured possession."
    </div>
    
    <p>The Law wasn't given to save them - they were already saved by the Passover lamb's blood! The Law was given to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Show them how to live as God's people</li>
        <li>Set them apart from other nations</li>
        <li>Reveal God's holy character</li>
        <li>Most importantly: <span class="highlight">Show them their need for a Savior</span></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Tabernacle: God With Us!</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "Then have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them" - Exodus 25:8
    </div>
    
    <p>God gives Moses detailed instructions for a portable temple. Every part points forward to Jesus - the gate (only one way in), the altar (sacrifice for sin), the bread (bread of life), the lampstand (light of the world)!</p>
    
    <h3>Breaking the Covenant Already!</h3>
    
    <p>While Moses is on the mountain receiving the law, the people get impatient. They pressure Aaron to make them a golden calf. "These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt!" They're breaking the first two commandments while Moses is still receiving them! This shows the heart of humanity's problem - we cannot keep God's law on our own.</p>

    <div class="time-marker">üèúÔ∏è Wilderness Wandering (5 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üòî The Cost of Unbelief</h2>
    
    <p>After leaving Mount Sinai, they finally reach the edge of the Promised Land. Moses sends twelve spies to scout it out. After 40 days, they return with a cluster of grapes so large it takes two men to carry it! The land truly flows with milk and honey.</p>
    
    <p>But ten spies give a terrifying report: "The people who live there are powerful... We seemed like grasshoppers in our own eyes." Only Joshua and Caleb trust God: "If the Lord delights in us, He will bring us into this land and give it to us!"</p>
    
    <p>The people side with the ten fearful spies. They even talk about choosing a new leader and going back to Egypt - back to slavery! After all God has done, they still don't trust Him.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "Not one of you will enter the land I swore with uplifted hand to make your home, except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun" - Numbers 14:30
    </div>
    
    <p>God declares that this entire generation will wander in the wilderness for 40 years. Everyone 20 years old and older will die in the wilderness, except Joshua and Caleb.</p>
    
    <h3>The Bronze Snake: Another Picture of Jesus!</h3>
    
    <p>When the people complain against God, venomous snakes bite them and many die. God tells Moses to make a bronze snake and put it on a pole. Anyone who looks at it will live.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "Just as Moses lifted up the snake in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes may have eternal life in him" - John 3:14-15
    </div>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">Jesus Himself said this pointed to His crucifixion - look and live!</span></p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>Even Moses Falls Short</h3>
    
    <p>Near the end of the 40 years, God tells Moses to speak to a rock and water will come out. But Moses is angry with the people. Instead of speaking to the rock, he strikes it twice. Water gushes out, but God says: "Because you did not trust in me enough to honor me as holy... you will not bring this community into the land."</p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">Even the greatest prophet of the Old Testament couldn't earn his way into the Promised Land!</span></p>
    
    <div class="discussion-box">
        <span class="bold">üí≠ Discussion Moment:</span> An entire generation saw God part the Red Sea, provide manna from heaven, and guide them with pillars of cloud and fire. Yet when faced with giants in the Promised Land, they chose fear over faith. What "giants" in your life cause you to doubt God's promises?
    </div>
    
    <h2>‚è∞ THE ULTIMATE CLIFFHANGER!</h2>
    
    <p>After 40 years of wandering, a new generation stands at the edge of the Promised Land. Moses climbs Mount Nebo and sees the land he'll never enter. God Himself buries Moses.</p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">Only Joshua and Caleb from the original generation will cross the Jordan River.</span> Will this new generation succeed where their parents failed? Will they finally trust God and enter His rest?</p>
    
    <h2>üìñ The Pattern Is Clear</h2>
    
    <p>Tonight we've seen:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every time humans try to keep God's covenant, they fail</li>
        <li>Every sacrifice points to a greater sacrifice needed</li>
        <li>Every deliverer falls short of complete deliverance</li>
        <li>Every covenant awaits a perfect covenant keeper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">We desperately need someone who can succeed where everyone else has failed!</span></p>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <span class="bold">Remember:</span> When covenants depend on human faithfulness, they get broken. When they depend on God's faithfulness, they endure forever!
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="prayer">
        <span class="bold">Prayer:</span> Father, thank You for Your patient love through every broken promise. Thank You for not giving up on us when we give up on ourselves. Help us to see our desperate need for a Savior who can keep the covenant perfectly on our behalf. In Jesus' name, Amen.
    </div>
    
    <h2>üìñ Next Time...</h2>
    
    <p class="center">In Session 2, we'll discover how God kept every single promise He ever made - by keeping them Himself. We'll meet the One who perfectly fulfilled every covenant, and we'll see how God's love story reaches its climax in the most unexpected way.</p>
    
    <p class="center bold">The pattern we've seen tonight continues - but God has a plan that's more beautiful than we could imagine!</p>
    
    <h2>üìö For Further Reading This Week:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Genesis 12:1-3 (God's promise to Abraham)</li>
        <li>Genesis 22:1-19 (Abraham and Isaac)</li>
        <li>Exodus 12 (The Passover)</li>
        <li>Numbers 14 (Israel's unbelief at the border)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="center italic">Remember: Every broken covenant in Session 1 is setting up the greatest love story ever told in Session 2!</p>
