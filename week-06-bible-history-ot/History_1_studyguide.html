    <h1>üìú Session 1: The Problem and the Promise</h1>
    <p class="center italic">God's Covenants and Humanity's Failure</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h2>üìö Welcome Friends!</h2>
    
    <p>Today we're beginning an incredible journey through God's love story. We'll discover something that will change how you see everything: God is a covenant-making, promise-keeping God, but humanity has a covenant-breaking, promise-forgetting problem.</p>
    
    <p>Here's something that will blow your mind: The Bible contains <span class="bold">66 books, written by 40 different authors over 1,500 years.</span> Yet these 66 books tell one unified story, about one hero: Jesus Christ.</p>
    
    <p>Here's my favorite way to think about the Bible: It's God's love letter to you. Picture an arranged marriage where a loving groom writes letter after letter to his future bride, telling her all about himself so their wedding day feels like meeting someone she already knows and loves.</p>
    
    <p>That's what God is doing through Scripture. Today in Session 1, we'll see God making beautiful promises to humanity - and humanity breaking every single one.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness" - 2 Timothy 3:16
    </div>

    <div class="time-marker">üôè Opening Prayer (4 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>ü§ù Understanding God's Covenant Heart</h2>
    
    <h3>What Is a Covenant?</h3>
    
    <p>A covenant is more than a contract. Contracts are about exchanging goods or services. Covenants are about relationships. They're binding promises between people who commit to be loyal to each other no matter what.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "A covenant is a sacred bond, sovereignly administered, with life-and-death consequences" - R.C. Sproul
    </div>
    
    <h3>God's Hesed Love</h3>
    
    <p>Here's a word that will change how you read the Bible: <span class="italic">hesed</span>. It's a Hebrew word appearing over 240 times in the Old Testament, meaning God's loyal, covenant-keeping, steadfast love.</p>
    
    <p>When your Bible says "steadfast love," that's <span class="italic">hesed</span>. It's God saying, "I have bound Myself to you, and I will never, ever let you go."</p>
    
    <h3>Two Types of Covenants</h3>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <p><span class="bold">Conditional covenants:</span> "If you do this, then I'll do that"</p>
        <p><span class="bold">Unconditional covenants:</span> "I will do this, period"</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üçé The First Covenant and Failure (6 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üåÖ Adam & Eve: Paradise Lost</h2>
    
    <p>In the beginning, God created a perfect world and placed the first humans in a beautiful garden.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "God saw all that he had made, and it was very good" - Genesis 1:31
    </div>
    
    <p><span class="bold">The Creation Covenant:</span> Enjoy this perfect world, rule over it with love, have relationship with Me, but don't eat from one tree. It wasn't because God was mean - it was because He wanted Adam and Eve to trust Him completely.</p>
    
    <p>But then came the heartbreak:</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "She took some and ate it. She also gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it" - Genesis 3:6
    </div>
    
    <p>In that moment, sin entered the world and broke everything. The first covenant was shattered by human disobedience.</p>
    
    <h3>But God's First Promise!</h3>
    
    <p>Even in judgment, God made a promise. Genesis 3:15 says the woman's offspring would crush the serpent's head. This is the first glimpse of a Savior!</p>
    
    <p><span class="bold">God Teaches the First Sacrifice:</span> Genesis 3:21 tells us God killed innocent animals to clothe Adam and Eve. This was the first sacrifice, teaching that sin requires death, but He would provide a substitute.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "The first grain of incense that ever smoked upon the altar of promise was this earliest word of hope" - Charles Spurgeon
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>From Bad to Worse</h3>
    
    <p>Things got worse fast. Cain killed Abel. Violence filled the earth.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "The Lord saw how great the wickedness of the human race had become on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of the human heart was only evil all the time" - Genesis 6:5
    </div>
    
    <div class="discussion-box">
        <span class="bold">üí≠ Discussion Moment:</span> Adam and Eve had everything they could want, yet they still chose to disobey. Why do you think having "everything" wasn't enough for them?
    </div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üåà The Covenant of Preservation (4 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>‚õµ Noah and the Rainbow Promise</h2>
    
    <p>God decided to start over with Noah, a man who "found favor in the eyes of the Lord." But let's be clear - this wasn't a cute children's story. This was God's holy wrath poured out against sin. Every person outside the ark died because sin cannot exist in God's presence.</p>
    
    <p>Yet in wrath, God showed mercy. He saved Noah's family, preserving humanity so the Savior could still come.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth" - Genesis 9:13
    </div>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <span class="bold">First UNCONDITIONAL Covenant!</span> God didn't say "IF you're good." He simply promised, period. The rainbow is God's signature on an unbreakable promise.
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üóº Tower of Babel (2 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üèóÔ∏è Pride vs. God's Mission</h2>
    
    <p>But humans didn't learn. In Genesis 11, they built a tower to "make a name for ourselves" and avoid being scattered. They were running from God's command to fill the earth.</p>
    
    <p>God confused their languages and scattered them. This created confusion and further separation from God Himself. Humanity was now divided by language, culture, and distance.</p>
    
    <p>But notice: <span class="highlight">the very next chapter introduces Abraham.</span> After rebellion created separation, God was about to reintroduce Himself to the world through one man.</p>
    
    <div class="time-marker">‚≠ê The Covenant of Promise (15 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üë®‚Äçü¶≥ Abraham: Father of Faith</h2>
    
    <p>Then comes one of the most beautiful moments in Scripture. God calls a man named Abram and makes him an incredible promise.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you" - Genesis 12:2-3
    </div>
    
    <p>Think about this: God promised to bless <span class="bold">ALL peoples on earth</span> through Abraham. That includes you! This was always about God's plan to rescue the whole world.</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <h3>God Makes Covenant with Himself</h3>
    
    <p>Here's something amazing: In Genesis 15, God made Abraham fall into deep sleep, then God alone walked between the sacrifice pieces. In ancient times, both parties would walk through, saying "May this happen to me if I break this promise."</p>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        But God made Abraham sleep so only GOD walked through! God was saying, "I'm making this covenant with Myself. You can't break it because you're not even awake to participate!"
    </div>
    
    <h3>Isaac: The Ultimate Test</h3>
    
    <p>Then came the test that would reveal something incredible about God's heart. God asked Abraham to sacrifice Isaac - the very son through whom the promise was to be fulfilled.</p>
    
    <p>Picture this scene: Abraham and Isaac climbing Mount Moriah. Isaac, carrying wood for his own sacrifice, asks, "Father, where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "God himself will provide the lamb for the burnt offering, my son" - Genesis 22:8
    </div>
    
    <p>More prophetic than Abraham knew!</p>
    
    <h3>Perfect Picture of Jesus!</h3>
    
    <p>Here's what God was showing:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><span class="bold">Isaac was the beloved son</span> - just like Jesus is God's beloved Son</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Isaac carried the wood</span> - just like Jesus carried His cross</li>
        <li><span class="bold">Isaac was willing to be sacrificed</span> - just like Jesus willingly gave His life</li>
        <li><span class="bold">God provided a substitute ram</span> - just like God provided Jesus as our substitute</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <p>When Abraham saw that ram caught in the thicket, he was getting a preview of the gospel! God was saying, "Abraham, I will provide the ultimate sacrifice. One day I will sacrifice My Son."</p>
    
    <div class="discussion-box">
        <span class="bold">üí≠ Discussion Moment:</span> God made Abraham wait 25 years for Isaac, but He kept His promise. What encourages you most about Abraham's story - his faith or God's faithfulness?
    </div>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üè∫ Providence and Preparation (4 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üåæ Joseph: God's Providence in Egypt</h2>
    
    <p>Joseph's story shows us how God works even through human evil. His brothers sold him into slavery, but God used even that evil for good.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives" - Genesis 50:20
    </div>
    
    <p><span class="bold">God's Covenant Faithfulness:</span> God preserved the covenant family through slavery and famine. Egypt became like a protective cocoon where God's people could grow from 70 people into a great nation.</p>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üìú The Covenant of Law (8 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üåä Moses and the Great Rescue</h2>
    
    <p>After 400 years, the Israelites had become slaves. They cried out to God:</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "God heard their groaning and he remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob. So God looked on the Israelites and was concerned about them" - Exodus 2:24-25
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <p><span class="bold">God "Remembers":</span> Doesn't mean He forgot! In Hebrew, "remember" means to act on what you know. God was about to fulfill His promise powerfully.</p>
    
    <p>Through ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea, God delivered His people. But this was about more than physical freedom - it was about creating a covenant relationship.</p>
    
    <h3>The Mosaic Covenant</h3>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <span class="bold">CONDITIONAL Covenant:</span> "If you obey my commands, you will be blessed; if you disobey, you will face consequences"
    </div>
    
    <p>The Law wasn't meant to save them - it was meant to show them how to live as God's people, and ultimately to show their need for a Savior.</p>
    
    <h3>The Tabernacle: God With Us!</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "Have them make a sanctuary for me, and I will dwell among them" - Exodus 25:8
    </div>
    
    <p>God wanted to live right in the middle of His people's camp! The tabernacle was a preview of Jesus - "Immanuel" (God with us).</p>
    
    <p>Every part pointed to Christ - the sacrificial altar (Jesus, perfect sacrifice), the veil (His body torn for us), the mercy seat (our meeting place with God).</p>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üèúÔ∏è Testing and Failure (4 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üòî The Covenant-Breaking Pattern</h2>
    
    <p>Even after witnessing incredible miracles, the Israelites complained, worshipped idols, and rebelled against God.</p>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <span class="bold">The Repeating Cycle:</span> God's grace ‚Üí human rebellion ‚Üí God's discipline ‚Üí God's grace again

    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "The Lord is slow to anger, abounding in love and forgiving sin and rebellion" - Numbers 14:18
    </div>
    
    <p>That's <span class="italic">hesed</span> love in action! But here's the sobering truth: because of unbelief, that entire generation died in the wilderness.</p>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">The Lesson: Human beings cannot keep God's covenants. We need someone to keep them for us.</span></p>

    <div class="time-marker">üëë Kings and the Temple (7 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üè∞ The Davidic Covenant</h2>
    
    <p>Eventually, Israel demanded a king. God gave them Saul, but Saul's heart turned away. So God chose David, "a man after his own heart."</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever" - 2 Samuel 7:16
    </div>
    
    <p>This promise ultimately points to Jesus, the Son of David who reigns eternally.</p>
    
    <h3>Solomon and the Temple</h3>
    
    <p>David's son Solomon built the magnificent temple in Jerusalem. When completed, "the glory of the Lord filled his temple."</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <p>The temple was the heart of Israel's spiritual life - where they offered sacrifices, celebrated feasts, met with God. Every lamb sacrificed pointed forward to Jesus, "the Lamb of God." The temple itself was a picture of Jesus - where God's glory dwells among us.</p>
    
    <p>After Solomon, the kingdom split into Israel (north) and Judah (south). Both struggled with idolatry, but God continued sending prophets to call them back.</p>
    
    <div class="time-marker">üíî The Ultimate Covenant Breaking (10 minutes)</div>
    
    <h2>üò± When Everything Fell Apart</h2>
    
    <p>Eventually, God's patience reached its limit. Israel was conquered by Assyria (722 BC), and Judah was taken into exile by Babylon (586 BC). The temple - God's dwelling place - was destroyed, Jerusalem lay in ruins.</p>
    
    <p>You have to understand how devastating this was. The temple wasn't just a building; it was where God's presence dwelled, where sins were forgiven, where heaven touched earth. Losing the temple felt like losing God Himself.</p>
    
    <p>Every covenant seemed shattered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Abrahamic covenant: descendants scattered</li>
        <li>Mosaic covenant: Law broken, curses activated</li>
        <li>Davidic covenant: No king on the throne</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The Prophets Speak Hope</h3>
    
    <p>But even in exile, God spoke through His prophets. Here's something amazing: God had prophets predict specific future events hundreds of years before they happened, so when those events came to pass, people would know only the supernatural God could have known the future.</p>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <p><span class="bold">Prophecies About the Coming Messiah:</span></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Isaiah: virgin birth (Isaiah 7:14) - 700 years early</li>
        <li>Isaiah: Suffering Servant (Isaiah 53:4)</li>
        <li>Micah: born in Bethlehem (Micah 5:2)</li>
        <li>Daniel: detailed prophecies exactly fulfilled</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These weren't lucky guesses - they were God proving He knows the end from the beginning.</p>
    
    <h3>The Promise of a New Covenant</h3>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        "I will put my law in their minds and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people" - Jeremiah 31:33
    </div>
    
    <p>This New Covenant would be different - written on hearts, not stone tablets. Instead of depending on human faithfulness, it would depend on God's faithfulness.</p>
    
    <h2>üé≠ The Cliffhanger Ending</h2>
    
    <p>Here's where our first session ends! We've seen God make covenant after covenant:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Creation Covenant with Adam (broken)</li>
        <li>Noahic Covenant (kept by God alone)</li>
        <li>Abrahamic Covenant (unconditional)</li>
        <li>Mosaic Covenant (broken repeatedly)</li>
        <li>Davidic Covenant (no king on throne)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="covenant-box">
        <span class="bold">The Pattern is Clear:</span> When covenants depend on human faithfulness, they get broken. When they depend on God's faithfulness, they endure forever.
    </div>
    
    <div class="page-break"></div>
    
    <p>The Old Testament ends with a promise and a question: God has promised a New Covenant that won't depend on human faithfulness. But how will He do it? How can God be both just (punishing sin) and loving (forgiving sinners)?</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        "The problem of reconciling human suffering with the existence of a God who loves, is only insoluble so long as we attach a trivial meaning to the word 'love'" - C.S. Lewis
    </div>
    
    <p><span class="highlight">The answer is coming. And when it comes, it will be more beautiful than anything the world has ever seen.</span></p>
    
    <div class="prayer">
        <span class="bold">Prayer:</span> Father, thank You for Your patient love through every broken promise. Thank You for not giving up on us when we give up on ourselves. Help us to wait expectantly for Your solution to the problem of our broken hearts. In Jesus' name, Amen.
    </div>
    
    <h2>üìñ Next Time...</h2>
    
    <p class="center">In Session 2, we'll discover how God kept every single promise He ever made - by keeping them Himself. We'll meet the One who perfectly fulfilled every covenant, and we'll see how God's love story reaches its climax in the most unexpected way.</p>
    
    <p class="center bold">God's <span class="italic">hesed</span> love never fails!</p>
