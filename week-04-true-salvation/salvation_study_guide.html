    <h1>True Salvation: An 80-Minute Teaching Session</h1>
    
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">5 minutes</div>
    
    <p>Welcome, everyone! Today we're diving into one of the most important topics you'll ever encounter: true salvation. I chose this topic because understanding salvation correctly literally determines where you'll spend eternity—and how you'll live today.</p>
    
    <p>Here's what we'll cover: <strong>(1) the problem of sin</strong>, <strong>(2) how God's law reveals that problem</strong>, <strong>(3) God's just response</strong>, <strong>(4) Christ's rescue plan</strong>, and <strong>(5) our reconciliation and new life</strong>.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <p>As Jonathan Edwards famously said, <em>"You contribute nothing to your salvation except the sin that made it necessary."</em> That might sound harsh, but it's actually the most freeing truth you'll ever hear. We'll see why throughout our time together.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Salvation means being rescued and reconciled to God. We'll explore how sin separated us from God and how Jesus bridges that gap through His life, death, and resurrection. By the end, you'll understand why we can't earn our way to God, why Christ had to come, and what it means to live as someone who's been truly saved.</p>
    
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    <h2>The Problem: Sin and Total Depravity</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">18 minutes</div>
    
    <div class="main-point">
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Every person is born alienated from God—"dead in sin"—and unable to restore that relationship on our own.
    </div>
    
    <p>Let's start with some hard truth. The Bible doesn't sugarcoat our condition:</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Romans 3:23 (NIV):</strong> <em>"for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Ephesians 2:1 (NIV):</strong> <em>"As for you, you were dead in your transgressions and sins."</em>
    </div>
    
    <p>Notice that word "dead"—not sick, not injured, but spiritually dead. A dead person can't help themselves.</p>
    
    <h3>What Is "Transgression"?</h3>
    <p>A transgression is simply an act of rebellion against God's commands—stepping over His boundary. But here's the thing: we don't just do bad things occasionally. Our very hearts are skewed away from God.</p>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <p>R.C. Sproul puts it this way: <em>"Original sin has marred our nature. We are depraved."</em> We're not just sinners because we do wrong things; we <strong>are</strong> sinners by nature.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <p>John Piper says, <em>"Men love darkness… We love darkness rather than light"</em> (referencing John 3:19). This shows how deep our problem goes—we actually prefer hiding from God rather than walking in His light.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Adam's Fall</h3>
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Romans 5:12 (NIV):</strong> <em>"sin entered the world through one man… and death came to all people, because all sinned."</em>
    </div>
    
    <p>Because of Adam's choice in the Garden of Eden, every human inherits a sinful nature. One man's act made many sinners. We're born with hearts that naturally rebel against God—this is called "total depravity."</p>
    
    <p>Here's something beautiful to notice: After Adam and Eve sinned, God clothed them with animal skins (Genesis 3:21). This required the death of innocent animals—the very first sacrifice. This was God's way of pointing forward to the ultimate sacrifice: Christ dying on the cross for our sins. Even in humanity's darkest moment, God was already planning our rescue.</p>
    
    <h3>Our "Good" Works Aren't Good Enough</h3>
    <p>Now, some of you might be thinking, "But what about all the good things I do?" Here's what God says about our best efforts:</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Isaiah 64:6 (NIV):</strong> <em>"All of us have become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous acts are like filthy rags; we all shrivel up like a leaf, and like the wind our sins sweep us away."</em>
    </div>
    
    <p>Even our "righteous acts"—our best moral efforts—are insufficient before a holy God. This isn't to discourage good deeds, but to show us that we can't earn our way to heaven.</p>
    
    <h3>Additional Scripture References:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>1 John 1:8 (NIV):</strong> <em>"If we claim to be without sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."</em></li>
        <li><strong>Romans 3:10 (NIV):</strong> <em>"There is no one righteous, not even one."</em></li>
        <li><strong>Romans 5:19 (NIV):</strong> <em>"For just as through the disobedience of the one man the many were made sinners..."</em></li>
        <li><strong>Genesis 3:21 (NIV):</strong> <em>"The Lord God made garments of skin for Adam and his wife and clothed them."</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="discussion-question">
        <strong>Discussion Question:</strong><br>
        <em>"If everyone is born spiritually dead, what hope do we have? Why can't we just try to be good people?"</em><br><br>
        <em>(Allow 2-3 responses. This sets up why we need God's intervention.)</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    <h2>The Law's Purpose</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">8 minutes</div>
    
    <div class="main-point">
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> God didn't give us the law because He expected us to follow it perfectly. Instead, He gave it to reveal our sinfulness—to show us just how far we fall short of His standards.
    </div>
    
    <h3>What Is "The Law"?</h3>
    <p>God's moral commands—like the Ten Commandments and moral instructions throughout Scripture—given to show us how we should live. But here's the key: the law's primary purpose isn't to save us; it's to show us our need for a Savior.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Romans 3:20 (NIV):</strong> <em>"Therefore no one will be declared righteous in God's sight by the works of the law; rather, through the law we become conscious of our sin."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="analogy">
        <h4>The Mirror Analogy</h4>
        <p>Think of the law like a mirror. When you look in a mirror, it has the power to show you dirt on your face, but it can't clean you. Only a bath can actually wash away the dirt.</p>
        
        <p>Similarly, God's law acts as a spiritual mirror, revealing our moral failures and need for cleansing, but it has no power to make us clean. That cleansing comes through baptism and God's grace.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p>The purpose of God's law isn't to produce self-righteousness but to expose our sinfulness and drive us to Christ. It shows us the standard, reveals how far we fall short, and points us to our need for a Savior.</p>
    
    <h3>Additional Scripture References:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Galatians 3:24 (NIV):</strong> <em>"So the law was our guardian until Christ came that we might be justified by faith."</em></li>
        <li><strong>Romans 7:7 (NIV):</strong> <em>"What shall we say, then? Is the law sinful? Certainly not! Nevertheless, I would not have known what sin was had it not been for the law."</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    <h2>God's Justice & Hell</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">10 minutes</div>
    
    <div class="main-point">
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Because God is holy and just, sin cannot go unpunished.
    </div>
    
    <p>Now, some of you might be thinking, "If God is loving, why doesn't He just overlook our sin?" Here's why He can't:</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Romans 6:23 (NIV):</strong> <em>"For the wages of sin is death..."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Matthew 25:46 (NIV):</strong> <em>"Then they will go away to eternal punishment, but the righteous to eternal life."</em>
    </div>
    
    <p>When we say "wages of sin is death," that means spiritual death (separation from God) and eventual physical death. God's love and justice aren't contradictory—they meet perfectly at the cross. But if someone rejects God's provision, His justice must still be carried out.</p>
    
    <p>Hell isn't God's "first choice"—it's the just consequence of un-atoned sin. A loving judge doesn't let criminals go free; he provides a way for the penalty to be paid.</p>
    
    <h3>Additional Scripture References:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Revelation 20:15 (NIV):</strong> <em>"Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire."</em></li>
        <li><strong>2 Thessalonians 1:9 (NIV):</strong> <em>"They will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord..."</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="discussion-question">
        <strong>Discussion Question:</strong><br>
        <em>"If God is loving, why does He allow hell? Doesn't that contradict His mercy?"</em><br><br>
        <em>(Emphasize: God's justice demands payment for sin. Love does not nullify justice. Instead, God provides a <strong>Substitute</strong>—Christ.)</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="separator"></div>
    
    <h2>Christ's Rescue Plan</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">30 minutes total</div>
    
    <p>This is where the gospel gets beautiful. God didn't leave us hopeless. He provided a way.</p>
    
    <h3>A) Incarnation & Sinless Life</h3>
    <div class="time-marker">10 minutes</div>
    
    <div class="main-point">
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> God Himself came to earth, lived a perfect life, and qualified to be our Substitute.
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Isaiah 9:6 (NIV):</strong> <em>"For to us a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government will be on his shoulders. He will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God..."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Luke 2:11 (NIV):</strong> <em>"Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord."</em>
    </div>
    
    <p>Jesus is fully God ("Mighty God") and fully man. By becoming a baby, He identified with us and could live on our behalf. But here's the crucial part—He had to live perfectly:</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Hebrews 4:15 (NIV):</strong> <em>"For we do not have a high priest who is unable to empathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet he did not sin."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="definition">
        <strong>What Is "Righteous"?</strong><br>
        Being righteous means being perfectly in right standing with God—never breaking a command. Only someone who is fully righteous can represent us before a holy God.
    </div>
    
    <p>Jesus lived the sinless life we couldn't live. He fulfilled God's law perfectly on our behalf.</p>
    
    <h4>Additional Scripture References:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>John 1:14 (NIV):</strong> <em>"The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us."</em></li>
        <li><strong>2 Corinthians 5:21 (NIV):</strong> <em>"God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="discussion-question">
        <strong>Discussion Question:</strong><br>
        <em>"Why couldn't God just forgive sin without someone dying? Why did Jesus have to live perfectly first?"</em><br><br>
        <em>(Emphasize: If someone who had never obeyed God died, it wouldn't satisfy God's justice—Jesus had to be righteous to stand in our place.)</em>
    </div>
    
    <h3>B) Atonement & Propitiation</h3>
    <div class="time-marker">15 minutes</div>
    
    <div class="main-point">
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Jesus' death on the cross is the payment for sin—He satisfied God's wrath. Our works cannot pay that debt.
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>1 John 2:2 (NIV):</strong> <em>"He is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not only for ours but also for the sins of the whole world."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Romans 3:25-26 (NIV):</strong> <em>"God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement, through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness..."</em>

    <div class="definition">
        <strong>Key Definitions:</strong><br>
        • <strong>"Atonement":</strong> The act by which Christ covers or removes our sin—He "at-ones" us with God.<br>
        • <strong>"Propitiation":</strong> Christ satisfying God's righteous wrath against sin. He takes the punishment we deserve.

        <h4>Good Works Analogy</h4>
        <p>Good works can't save us. This doesn't mean we don't have enough good deeds—it means we're using the wrong currency entirely.</p>
        
        <p>Imagine returning from a trip to Japan with thousands of dollars worth of yen in your wallet. You stop at an airport store to buy a $2 bottle of water, but when you try to pay with yen, the cashier refuses. You could explain that what you're offering is worth far more than the cost of the water, but it doesn't matter—it's simply the wrong currency for this transaction.</p>
        
        <p>The same principle applies spiritually. Good works, no matter how valuable they may seem, are the wrong currency for salvation. God operates on an entirely different system—one based on grace and faith, not our efforts or achievements.</p>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Scripture on Grace & Mercy:</h4>
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Ephesians 2:8-9 (NIV):</strong> <em>"For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— not by works, so that no one can boast."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Ephesians 2:4-5 (NIV):</strong> <em>"But because of his great love for us, God, who is rich in mercy, made us alive with Christ even when we were dead in transgressions."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="quote">
        <p>John Owen said: <em>"We are justified freely by His grace, and all boasting is excluded."</em></p>
    </div>
    
    <p>Grace is the "currency" God accepts. Faith is our "hand" that receives the gift.</p>

    <h3>C) Resurrection</h3>
    <div class="time-marker">5 minutes</div>
    
    <div class="main-point">
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Because Jesus rose from the dead, our salvation is secured; death is defeated.
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (NIV):</strong> <em>"For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures."</em>
    </div>
    
    <p>The resurrection proves that God accepted Christ's payment for sin. If He had not risen, the debt would not be paid. But because He lives, we too will rise.</p>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Romans 4:25 (NIV):</strong> <em>"He was delivered over to death for our sins and was raised to life for our justification."</em>
    </div>
    
    <h4>Additional Scripture References:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Romans 6:4 (NIV):</strong> <em>"We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life."</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <div class="discussion-question">
        <strong>Brief Discussion Question:</strong><br>
        <em>"Why is the resurrection so crucial? Could we be saved if Christ stayed dead?"</em><br><br>
        <em>(Answer: No—without resurrection, His sacrifice is incomplete.)</em>

    <h2>Reconciliation & New Life</h2>
    <div class="time-marker">10 minutes</div>
    
    <div class="main-point">
        <strong>Main Point:</strong> Once Christ has paid for our sins, we are declared righteous and brought back into fellowship with God.
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Romans 3:28 (NIV):</strong> <em>"For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the works of the law."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>2 Corinthians 5:18 (NIV):</strong> <em>"All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us the ministry of reconciliation."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>John 17:3 (NIV):</strong> <em>"Now this is eternal life: that they know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom you have sent."</em>
    </div>
    
    <div class="definition">
        <strong>Key Concepts:</strong><br>
        • <strong>"Justified":</strong> God declares us righteous—He credits Christ's perfect obedience and payment to our account.<br>
        • <strong>"Reconciliation":</strong> We were God's enemies; now we are His children. The barrier of sin is removed.<br>
        • <strong>"New Life":</strong> We're not just "forgiven"—we're born again.
    </div>
    
    <div class="scripture">
        <strong>Ephesians 2:6 (NIV):</strong> <em>"And God raised us up with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms in Christ Jesus."</em>
    </div>
    
    <p>Eternal life isn't just a future ticket to heaven; it's knowing God now and forever.</p>

In His perfect love and justice, He sent Christ—God in flesh—to live a righteous life, die as our substitute, and rise again so that whoever trusts in Him is justified by faith alone, reconciled to God, and given new life.
